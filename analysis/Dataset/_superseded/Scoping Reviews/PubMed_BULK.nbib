TI  - Use of Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Scoping Review.
PG  - e24087
LID - 10.2196/24087 [doi]
LID - e24087
AB  - BACKGROUND: With over 37.8 million cases and over 1 million deaths worldwide, the 
      COVID-19 pandemic has created a societal and economic upheaval of unparalleled 
      magnitude. A positive transformation has been brought about by innovative 
      solutions in the health care sector that aim to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 
      on human health. For instance, the use of telehealth has been on the rise amidst 
      this public health emergency. OBJECTIVE: Given the unprecedented scale of the 
      pandemic with no definitive endpoint, we aimed to scope the existing 
      telehealth-related literature during a defined period of the ongoing pandemic 
      (ie, January to June 2020). METHODS: Our scoping review was guided by the Joanna 
      Briggs Institute Reviewer Manual. We systematically searched PubMed and Embase 
      databases with specific eligibility criteria. Data extracted from the shortlisted 
      articles included first author and affiliation, journal title, publication type, 
      terminologies used to describe telehealth and their accompanying definitions, 
      health discipline or medical specialties and subspecialties wherein telehealth 
      had been applied, the purpose of telehealth use, and the authors' overall 
      sentiment on telehealth use. We collated the available information and used 
      descriptive statistics to analyze the synthesized data. RESULTS: In all, 543 
      articles published across 331 different journals were included in this scoping 
      review. The Journal of Medical Internet Research and its sister journals featured 
      the highest number of articles (25/543, 4.6%). Nearly all (533/543, 98.2%) 
      articles were in English. The majority of the articles were opinions, 
      commentaries, and perspectives (333/543, 61.3%). Most authors of the articles 
      reviewed were from high-income countries (470/543, 86.6%), especially from the 
      United States of America (237/543, 43.6%). In all, 39 different definitions were 
      used to describe terms equivalent to telehealth. A small percentage (42/543, 
      7.7%) of the articles focused on the provision of COVID-19-related care. 
      Moreover, 49.7% (270/543) of the articles primarily focused on the provision of 
      multiple components of clinical care, and 23% (125/543) of the articles focused 
      on various specialties and subspecialties of internal medicine. For a vast 
      majority (461/543, 84.9%) of the articles, the authors expressed a celebratory 
      sentiment about the use of telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified 
      considerable emerging literature on telehealth during the first six months of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, albeit mostly from high-income countries. There is compelling 
      evidence to suggest that telehealth may have a significant effect on advancing 
      health care in the future. However, the feasibility and application of telehealth 
      in resource-limited settings and low- and middle-income countries must be 
      established to avail its potential and transform health care for the world's 
      population. Given the rapidity with which telehealth is advancing, a global 
      consensus on definitions, boundaries, protocols, monitoring, evaluation, and data 
      privacy is urgently needed.

TI  - Nurse managers' competencies: A scoping review.
PG  - 1410-1419
LID - 10.1111/jonm.13380 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To describe and synthesize scientific literature on nurse managers' 
      competencies. BACKGROUND: The key strategy for the success of health 
      organisations currently resides in the capacity of the nurse manager to develop 
      advanced competencies in management. However, there is a lack of systematic 
      reviews that synthesize knowledge about nurse managers' competencies. EVALUATION: 
      A scoping review was conducted using electronic databases including Web of 
      Science, Scopus, PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature. KEY ISSUES: After the first analysis, 392 competencies were observed 
      from 76 studies. Finally, 53 competencies were grouped according to their 
      characteristics. The two most-cited competencies were communication and finance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the competencies required by nurse managers can help 
      organisations create strategies to develop competent managers. In addition, from 
      the results we can infer what might be the core competencies, since 22 main 
      competencies from the total number were identified. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING 
      MANAGEMENT: The competencies identified constitute the body of knowledge 
      necessary for nurse managers. In addition, it is possible to generate a pathway 
      for learning and professional development for nurses before they work at the 
      microlevel of management. The starting point for this pathway could be the 22 
      core competencies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a scoping review of the literature on apathy in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), to better understand how apathy in Parkinson's disease is 
      diagnosed, treated and managed. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 
      Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic 
      Reviews were searched to 17 May 2017. An updated review was run from 17 May 2017 
      to 28 January 2019. The grey literature was searched using the CADTH Grey Matters 
      tool. Original peer-reviewed research was included if it included individuals 
      with PD and apathy. Non-original data was only included if it was in the form of 
      meta-analysis. All information regarding diagnosis, treatment and management of 
      PD was extracted. Citation screening and extraction were performed in duplicate. 
      RESULTS: From 11 375 citations, 362 articles were included in the final review. 
      The majority of included studies focussed on prevalence, with few studies 
      examining treatment. Twenty screening tools for apathy were identified. Fifty per 
      cent of treatment studies were randomised control trials (RCTs). RCTs applied 
      treatment methods including: exercise, mindfulness, rotigotine (Neupro) 
      transdermal patch and rivastigmine (Exelon). CONCLUSIONS: This review identified 
      a large body of literature describing current knowledge on diagnosing, treating 
      and managing apathy in PD. Future research should aim to detect an ideal 
      screening tool for apathy in PD, to identify the best treatment options for 
      apathy and the variety of comorbidities it may present with and finally aim to 
      better understand postoperative apathy in those with deep brain stimulation.

TI  - Hospital falls prevention with patient education: a scoping review.
PG  - 140
LID - 10.1186/s12877-020-01515-w [doi]
LID - 140
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital falls remain a frequent and debilitating problem worldwide. 
      Most hospital falls prevention strategies have targeted clinician education, 
      environmental modifications, assistive devices, hospital systems and medication 
      reviews. The role that patients can play in preventing falls whilst in hospital 
      has received less attention. This critical review scopes patient falls education 
      interventions for hospitals. The quality of the educational designs under-pinning 
      patient falls education programmes was also evaluated. The outcomes of 
      patient-centred falls prevention programs were considered for a range of hospital 
      settings and diagnoses. METHODS: The Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework for 
      scoping reviews was adapted using Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA-ScR 
      guidelines. Eight databases, including grey literature, were searched from 
      January 2008 until February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the 
      articles and data were extracted and summarised thematically. The quality of 
      falls prevention education programs for patients was also appraised using a 
      modified quality metric tool. RESULTS: Forty-three articles were included in the 
      final analysis. The interventions included: (i) direct face-to-face patient 
      education about falls risks and mitigation; (ii) educational tools; (iii) 
      patient-focussed consumer materials such as pamphlets, brochures and handouts; 
      and (iv) hospital systems, policies and procedures to assist patients to prevent 
      falls. The included studies assessed falls or education related outcomes before 
      and after patient falls prevention education. Few studies reported incorporating 
      education design principles or educational theories. When reported, most 
      educational programs were of low to moderate quality from an educational design 
      perspective. CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging evidence that hospital falls 
      prevention interventions that incorporate patient education can reduce falls and 
      associated injuries such as bruising, lacerations or fractures. The design, mode 
      of delivery and quality of educational design influence outcomes. Well-designed 
      education programs can improve knowledge and self-perception of risk, empowering 
      patients to reduce their risk of falling whilst in hospital.

TI  - Climate Change and Mental Health: A Scoping Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18094486 [doi]
LID - 4486
AB  - Climate change is negatively impacting the mental health of populations. This 
      scoping review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change 
      and mental health across the World Health Organisation's (WHO) five global 
      research priorities for protecting human health from climate change. We conducted 
      a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental health 
      and climate change using online academic databases. We assessed the quality of 
      studies where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identified 120 
      original studies published between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative 
      (n = 67), cross-sectional (n = 42), conducted in high-income countries (n = 87), 
      and concerned with the first of the WHO global research priorities-assessing the 
      mental health risks associated with climate change (n = 101). Several 
      climate-related exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, 
      wildfires, and floods were associated with psychological distress, worsened 
      mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing mental health 
      conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. 
      Few studies (n = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of 
      protecting health from climate change (effective interventions (n = 8); 
      mitigation and adaptation (n = 7); improving decision-support (n = 3); and cost 
      estimations (n = 1)). While climate change and mental health represents a rapidly 
      growing area of research, it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond 
      with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.

TI  - Understanding professional identity in occupational therapy: A scoping review.
PG  - 175-197
LID - 10.1080/11038128.2021.1974548 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A strong professional identity helps occupational therapists 
      maintain professional values and thrive when facing work-related challenges and 
      opportunities including generic, blurred or emerging roles, funding pressures and 
      a push for outcome evidence. A scoping review will build understanding of 
      professional identity and how to maintain it in such circumstances. OBJECTIVES: 
      To scope what is currently understood of professional identity in occupational 
      therapy and factors which influence ability to maintain this and adapt in 
      challenging work environments. METHODS: Using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping 
      review framework three databases were searched using the terms 'occupational 
      therap*' and 'professional identity'. Data extraction and thematic analysis 
      highlighted the extent and nature of current literature and mapped key concepts. 
      RESULTS: 89 papers were included. Professional identity was revealed as a 
      multidimensional construction. Four themes emerged: developing a shared ontology, 
      embracing the culture, enacting occupational therapy, and believing in 
      occupational therapy. Factors which influenced development and maintenance of 
      professional identity included occupation-centred practice, ontological 
      reflexivity, linking theory to practice and professional socialization. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The enhanced understanding of professional identity 
      and factors which preserve or enhance it can help the profession identify how to 
      position itself to remain resilient and adaptive in an ever-changing environment.

TI  - Effects of interdental cleaning devices in preventing dental caries and 
      periodontal diseases: a scoping review.
PG  - 327-337
LID - 10.1111/adj.12722 [doi]
AB  - To identify and map existing evidence on the effectiveness of interdental 
      cleaning devices in preventing dental caries and periodontal diseases, a scoping 
      review was carried out by electronically searching PubMed, Scopus and Embase. 
      Studies on interdental cleaning devices, written in English, and published from 
      January 2008 up to April 2019 were included in the review. Of 1860 studies 
      identified, six systematic reviews (SR) were included in the review. One SR each 
      was on flossing, interdental brushes, wood sticks and oral irrigation. Of two SR 
      on multitude of interdental cleaning devices, one assessed comparative efficacy 
      while the other both the individual and comparative efficacy. All reviews had 
      assessed the heterogeneity and the methodological quality of studies included, 
      and performed data extraction and meta-analysis where appropriate. Evidence 
      ranged from weak to moderate with very low- to low-certainty for the adjunctive 
      benefit of these devices to control plaque and gingivitis. It warrants long-term 
      studies with sufficient power and those assessing the impact of interdental 
      cleaning on interproximal caries to corroborate such evidence. Available evidence 
      on the efficacy of interdental cleaning devices suggests that dental 
      practitioners recommend patient-specific interdental cleaning devices that enable 
      patients to achieve a safe and high standard of interdental cleaning.

TI  - A scoping review of US insurers' use of patient-reported outcomes.
PG  - e232-e238
LID - 10.37765/ajmc.2022.89162 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To complete a scoping review of US health insurers' use of 
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). 
      STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: A literature search was constructed for 
      articles that contained an insurer-related term and an HRQOL-related term between 
      1999 and 2019 using the MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of 
      Systematic Reviews, EconLit, and Business Source Complete databases. RESULTS: The 
      search identified 14,253 unduplicated records, of which 2340 passed abstract 
      screening and 350 were included in the review. The populations addressed in these 
      studies included both populations with specific health conditions (eg, diabetes) 
      and an entire member population. The most common purpose of the article was to 
      evaluate a policy or program (n = 255; 72.9%); the range of interventions 
      evaluated included federal policy, subgroup management strategies, and 
      identification of individual patients. The most common insurance mechanism was 
      Medicare (n = 205; 58.6%). The most common source of data was collected 
      specifically for a research project (n = 172; 49.1%), and the least common source 
      of data was collected by providers at the point of care (n = 34; 9.7%). The most 
      commonly addressed age group was 65 years and older (n = 262; 74.9%), and the 
      least commonly addressed was younger than 18 years (n = 36; 10.3%). The most 
      commonly used PROMs were single-item self-rated health (n = 138; 47.1%) and 
      activities of daily living (n = 88; 30.0%), with validated depression 
      questionnaires (n = 56; 19.1%) being the most common disease-focused 
      questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: This review found a wide variety of articles across 
      insurance providers, health conditions, and uses of PROMs. There is a noted 
      paucity of data in pediatric populations and little information about the use of 
      data collected within health care settings that is transmitted to health 
      insurers.

TI  - Impostor syndrome among physicians and physicians in training: A scoping review.
PG  - 116-124
LID - 10.1111/medu.13956 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Impostor syndrome (IS) is increasingly recognised as a condition among 
      physicians and physicians in training. Impostor syndrome is especially 
      problematic because of its association with increased rates of burnout and 
      suicide. In order to address this issue, we need to fully understand its 
      prevalence, scope, and factors associated with IS. The purpose of this scoping 
      review is to analyse the existing literature on IS among practising physicians 
      and physicians in training in order to identify current trends and directions for 
      future research. METHODS: The authors conducted a literature search of nine 
      databases for any articles on IS among practising physicians or physicians in 
      training published prior to January 2019. Two reviewers independently screened 
      articles and identified 18 papers meeting the study inclusion criteria. Two 
      authors independently extracted data and performed quantitative and qualitative 
      syntheses consistent with best practice recommendations for scoping reviews. 
      RESULTS: Most studies utilised the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale and cited 
      rates of IS ranging from 22% to 60%. Studies found that gender, low self-esteem 
      and institutional culture were associated with higher rates of IS, whereas social 
      support, validation of success, positive affirmation, and both personal and 
      shared reflections were protective. Overall, IS was also associated with higher 
      rates of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarises the existing literature on 
      IS among practising physicians and physicians in training, providing valuable 
      insights and areas for future research.

TI  - A scoping review of physical activity interventions for older adults.
PG  - 82
LID - 10.1186/s12966-021-01140-9 [doi]
LID - 82
AB  - BACKGROUND: To inform implementation and future research, this scoping review 
      investigates the volume of evidence for physical activity interventions among 
      adults aged 60+. Our research questions are: (1) what is the evidence regarding 
      interventions designed to increase total physical activity in adults aged 60+ 
      years, in accordance with three of the four strategic objectives of GAPPA (active 
      societies, active environments, active people); (2) what is the current evidence 
      regarding the effectiveness of physical activity programmes and services designed 
      for older adults?; and (3) What are the evidence gaps requiring further research? 
      METHODS: We searched PEDro, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane from 1 January 2010 to 1 
      November 2020 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of physical activity 
      interventions in adults aged 60+. We identified interventions designed to: (1) 
      increase physical activity; and (2) deliver physical activity programmes and 
      services in home, community or outpatient settings. We extracted and coded data 
      from eligible reviews according to our proposed framework informed by TIDieR, 
      Prevention of Falls Network Europe (PROFANE), and WHO's International 
      Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). We classified the 
      overall findings as positive, negative or inconclusive. RESULTS: We identified 39 
      reviews of interventions to increase physical activity and 342 reviews of 
      programmes/services for older adults. Interventions were predominantly structured 
      exercise programmes, including balance strength/resistance training, and physical 
      recreation, such as yoga and tai chi. There were few reviews of health 
      promotion/coaching and health professional education/referral, and none of sport, 
      workplace, sociocultural or environmental interventions. Fewer reported outcomes 
      of total physical activity, social participation and quality of life/well-being. 
      We noted insufficient coverage in diverse and disadvantaged samples and 
      low-middle income countries. CONCLUSIONS: There is a modest but growing volume of 
      evidence regarding interventions designed to increase total physical activity in 
      older adults, although more interventional studies with long term follow-up are 
      needed, particularly for GAPPA 1. Active Societies and GAPPA 2. Active 
      Environments. By comparison, there is abundant evidence for GAPPA 3. specific 
      programmes and services, but coverage of sport and workplace interventions, and 
      diverse samples and settings is lacking. Comprehensive reviews of individual 
      studies are now needed as well as research targeting neglected outcomes, 
      populations and settings.

TI  - Pediatric surgical errors: A systematic scoping review.
PG  - 616-621
LID - S0022-3468(21)00529-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2021.07.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical errors were largely concealed prior to the landmark report 
      "To Err Is Human". The purpose of this systematic scoping review was to determine 
      the extent pediatric surgery defines and studies errors, and to explore themes 
      among papers focused on errors in pediatric surgery. METHODS: The methodological 
      framework used to conduct this scoping study has been outlined by Arksey and 
      O'Malley. In January 2020, PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
      and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Oxford 
      Level of Evidence was assigned to each study; only studies rated Level 3 or 
      higher were included. RESULTS: Of 3,064 initial studies, 12 were included in the 
      final analysis: 4 cohort studies, and 8 outcome/audit studies. This data 
      represented 5,442,000 aggregate patients and 8,893 errors. There were 6 different 
      error definitions and 5 study methods. Common themes amongst the studies included 
      a systems-focused approach, an increase in errors seen with increased complexity, 
      and studies exploring the relationship between error and adverse events. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed multiple error definitions, multiple error study 
      methods, and common themes described in the pediatric surgical literature. 
      Opportunities exist to improve the safety of surgical care of children by 
      reducing errors. Original Scientific Research Type of Study: Systematic Scoping 
      Review Level of Evidence Rating: 1.

TI  - Altruism in Paramedicine: A Scoping Review.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10091731 [doi]
LID - 1731
AB  - While altruism has been studied in healthcare professions such as nursing and 
      medicine, the exploration of the characteristics of altruism, as related to 
      paramedicine and emergency care in Australia, is limited. This scoping review 
      explores altruism in paramedicine from the perspective of the paramedic as 
      practitioner, learner, and educator as seen through the lens of the paramedic and 
      the patient. Also discussed is the positive impact of altruism on the patient 
      experience of care. A scoping review was used to assess the availability of data 
      related to altruism in paramedicine. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews was used to guide the 
      process. Search categories were orientated around the subject (altruism) and 
      discipline (paramedicine). A total of 27 articles are included in this scoping 
      review. Initial searching identified 742 articles; after duplicate removal, 396 
      articles were screened with 346 excluded. Fifty articles were full-text reviewed 
      and 23 excluded. The final 27 were extracted following full-text screening. None 
      of the articles are specific to altruism in paramedicine. The data related to the 
      practice of altruism in paramedicine are extremely limited. The preponderance of 
      data arise from Europe and North America which, due to crewing and service 
      differences, may impact the practice of altruism in different regions. Recent 
      changes to the scope of paramedic practice, workload, education, and case acuity 
      may influence behaviour regarding altruism, compassion, caring, and associated 
      caring behaviours. The practice and education of paramedics including altruism, 
      compassion, caring and caring behaviours in the Australasian setting warrants 
      further research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Including neuroscience concepts in teacher training has continued to 
      gain interest. While many studies advocate for this, little is known about 
      currently published research. METHODS: The framework for a scoping review was 
      followed in order to generate a more comprehensive understanding of current 
      research on neuroscience training for teachers. The present study aims to: (1) 
      describe the scope of existing research; (2) summarize findings; and (3) provide 
      recommendations for future inquiry. RESULTS: Limited studies and methodological 
      issues prevent strong conclusions from being drawn about the impact of this 
      training although most results are promising. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review 
      provides the first comprehensive summary of the existing research on neuroscience 
      training for teachers and discusses a number of considerations for improving 
      future research in this area.

TI  - Digital technology and nursing care: a scoping review on acceptance, 
      effectiveness and efficiency studies of informal and formal care technologies.
PG  - 400
LID - 10.1186/s12913-019-4238-3 [doi]
LID - 400
AB  - BACKGROUND: The existence, usage and benefits of digital technologies in nursing 
      care are relevant topics in the light of the current discussion on technologies 
      as possible solutions to problems such as the shortage of skilled workers and the 
      increasing demand for long-term care. A lack of good empirical overviews of 
      existing technologies in the present literature prompted us to conduct this 
      review. Its purpose was to map the field of digital technologies for informal and 
      formal care that have already been explored in terms of acceptance, effectiveness 
      and efficiency (AEE), and to show the scope of the used methods, target settings, 
      target groups and fields of support. METHODS: A systematic literature search was 
      conducted using Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ACM Digital Library, 
      IEEE Xplore, the Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies, GeroLit and 
      CareLit. In addition, project websites were manually screened for relevant 
      publications. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifteen papers were included in the review. 
      Effectiveness studies have been most frequently performed for ICT, robots and 
      sensors. Acceptance studies often focussed on ICT, robots and EHR/EMR. Efficiency 
      studies were generally rare. Many studies were found to have a low level of 
      evidence. Experimental designs with small numbers and without control groups were 
      the most common methods used to evaluate acceptance and effectiveness. Study 
      designs with high evidence levels were most commonly found for ICT, robots and 
      e-learning. Technologies evaluated for informal caregivers and children or 
      indicated for formal care at home or in cross-sectoral care were rare. 
      CONCLUSION: We recommend producing high-quality evaluations on existing digital 
      technologies for AEE in real-life settings rather than systematic reviews with 
      low-quality studies. More focus should be placed on research into efficiency. 
      Future research should be devoted to a closer examination of the applied AEE 
      evaluation methods. Policymakers should provide funding to enable large-scale, 
      long-term evaluations of technologies in the practice of care, filling the 
      research gaps for technologies, target settings and target groups identified in 
      this review.

TI  - Child Nutrition in Disaster: A Scoping Review.
PG  - 103-118
LID - 10.1620/tjem.256.103 [doi]
AB  - Disaster endangers the nutritional health of children with resulting effects on 
      their mental, physical, and social well-being. Adequate infant and young child 
      feeding (IYCF) in disaster prevents malnutrition and save lives. Although much 
      progress has been made in nutritional support in disaster, malnutrition among 
      children is still evident. This scoping review study was conducted to identify 
      gaps in child nutrition in disaster. Published articles (1946-2020) in PubMed 
      were sought primarily and were assessed with some additional relevant articles. 
      Overall, 103 articles were included in the scope of this review. Increased 
      morbidity and mortality from malnutrition (macro- and micro-nutrient 
      deficiencies), communicable diseases and mental health issues are nutritional 
      effects of disaster. Pre-disaster malnutrition, food insecurity, living 
      environments in shelters, poor breast-feeding practices, sociocultural factors, 
      and organizational and administrative challenges strongly affect child nutrition 
      in disaster. The efforts and collaboration of relief agencies resulted in the 
      development of standardized guidelines and codes represented as the Sphere 
      Project and Operational Guideline for IYCF in Emergency. This study recommends a 
      well-coordinated and explicit approach that includes preparedness, advocacy, 
      development/updating of policies, and education of children, family and relief 
      aid workers on nutrition. Periodic nutritional assessment of children and 
      nutritional support in disaster by designated IYCF authority are necessary. 
      Education and participation of the general population are also important. Future 
      assessments must examine food allergies in children and nutrition effects on 
      child mental health in disaster.

AB  - Depression is a prevalent comorbidity in patients with severe physical disorders, 
      such as cancer, stroke, and coronary diseases. Although it can significantly 
      impact the course of the primary disease, the signs of depression are often 
      underestimated and overlooked. The aim of this paper was to review algorithms for 
      the automatic, uniform, and multimodal classification of signs of depression from 
      human conversations and to evaluate their accuracy. For the scoping review, the 
      PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews were followed. In the scoping review, the 
      search yielded 1095 papers, out of which 20 papers (8.26%) included more than two 
      modalities, and 3 of those papers provided codes. Within the scope of this 
      review, supported vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and long short-term 
      memory network (LSTM; with gated and non-gated recurrent units) models, as well 
      as different combinations of features, were identified as the most widely 
      researched techniques. We tested the models using the DAIC-WOZ dataset (original 
      training dataset) and using the SymptomMedia dataset to further assess their 
      reliability and dependency on the nature of the training datasets. The best 
      performance was obtained by the LSTM with gated recurrent units (F1-score of 0.64 
      for the DAIC-WOZ dataset). However, with a drop to an F1-score of 0.56 for the 
      SymptomMedia dataset, the method also appears to be the most data-dependent.

TI  - A scoping review of machine learning in psychotherapy research.
PG  - 92-116
LID - 10.1080/10503307.2020.1808729 [doi]
AB  - Machine learning (ML) offers robust statistical and probabilistic techniques that 
      can help to make sense of large amounts of data. This scoping review paper aims 
      to broadly explore the nature of research activity using ML in the context of 
      psychological talk therapies, highlighting the scope of current methods and 
      considerations for clinical practice and directions for future research. Using a 
      systematic search methodology, fifty-one studies were identified. A narrative 
      synthesis indicates two types of studies, those who developed and tested an ML 
      model (k=44), and those who reported on the feasibility of a particular treatment 
      tool that uses an ML algorithm (k=7). Most model development studies used 
      supervised learning techniques to classify or predict labeled treatment process 
      or outcome data, whereas others used unsupervised techniques to identify clusters 
      in the unlabeled patient or treatment data. Overall, the current applications of 
      ML in psychotherapy research demonstrated a range of possible benefits for 
      indications of treatment process, adherence, therapist skills and treatment 
      response prediction, as well as ways to accelerate research through automated 
      behavioral or linguistic process coding. Given the novelty and potential of this 
      research field, these proof-of-concept studies are encouraging, however, do not 
      necessarily translate to improved clinical practice (yet).

TI  - A scoping review of child grooming strategies: pre- and post-internet.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Researchers have studied the online sexual grooming of minors 
      extensively since the early 2000s. However, the grooming process is neither new 
      nor restricted to digital media. While grooming and child sexual abuse existed 
      long before the Internet, the advent of the Internet has resulted in more ways in 
      which offenders can interact with candidate victims including offline-only, 
      online-only, and a mix of offline and online. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we 
      conducted a scoping review of grooming strategies both pre- and post-Internet. 
      Our goal was to enumerate strategies analyzed in both time periods, provide 
      similarities and differences, and discuss how changing datasets and technology 
      have impacted the grooming process in both online and offline environments. 
      METHODS: We performed a scoping review of peer-reviewed journal articles from 
      1970 to 2020 within PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo, and ERIC. This resulted in 19,679 
      unique articles. Titles and abstracts were screened resulting in 266 articles 
      which were then read in full, resulting in 93 papers which qualified based on 
      inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Grooming strategies identified pre-Internet 
      included: enticements, coercion, isolation, substance abuse, gradual 
      sexualization, and secrecy. In comparison, the strategies identified 
      post-Internet were: enticements, risk assessment, trust, sexualization, fantasy, 
      secrecy, isolation, meeting, media progression, deception, coercion, substance 
      use as a tool, authority, and repetition. CONCLUSIONS: While grooming strategies 
      overlapped pre and post-Internet, the timing and scope of concepts differed. 
      Additionally, grooming offline began to incorporate technology post-Internet 
      which functioned to increase accessibility and isolation of the victim in a 
      similar manner to online grooming.

TI  - Rehabilitation workforce descriptors: a scoping review.
PG  - 1169
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-08531-z [doi]
LID - 1169
AB  - BACKGROUND: A comprehensive, accurate description of workforce capacity is 
      important for health service planning, to ensure that health services meet local 
      needs. In many low- to middle-income countries, the government's service planning 
      ability is barred by the lack of accurate and/or comprehensively-described 
      workforce data. In these low-resource settings, lack of appropriate planning 
      leads to limited or no access to rehabilitation services. Variability in the 
      definitions and scope of rehabilitation professionals further complicates the 
      understanding of rehabilitation services and how it should be planned and 
      delivered. Another challenge to describing the primary rehabilitation workforce 
      capacity, is the lack of standardised and agreed-upon global metrics. These 
      inconsistencies highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of current 
      practices, which can offer guidance to countries wishing to describe their 
      rehabilitation workforce. This study aimed to scope the range of descriptors and 
      metrics used to describe the rehabilitation workforce and to compare the 
      workforce across countries that used similar descriptors in published reports. 
      METHODS: A scoping review was conducted according to the five-step framework 
      first developed by Arksey and O'Malley. The review included a broad search of 
      literature regarding the rehabilitation workforce and how countries quantify and 
      describe the rehabilitation workforce. RESULTS: Nineteen studies on 
      rehabilitation workforce capacity were identified. All but one (a cross-sectional 
      study) were database reviews. The main descriptors and indicators used to 
      describe the rehabilitation workforce capacity were profession type, age, gender, 
      distributions between urban/rural, level of care, and private/public sectors, 
      absolute count totals, and population-adjusted ratios. CONCLUSION: This scoping 
      review provided an overview of descriptors and indicators used to describe the 
      rehabilitation workforce capacity internationally. The study is a first step 
      towards developing standardised descriptors and metrics to quantify the 
      rehabilitation workforce capacity, that will allow for comparison between 
      different settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This scoping review protocol has been 
      registered with the Open Science Framework (http://osf.10/7h6xz).

TI  - A Scoping Review on the Experience of Participating in Dignity Therapy for Adults 
      at the End of Life.
PG  - 1143-1150
LID - 10.1089/jpm.2021.0498 [doi]
AB  - Background: As the proportion of aging population is increasing, so is the need 
      for palliative care services. The end of life is marked by suffering and 
      currently it is not well addressed in palliative care. Dignity therapy (DT) is 
      one of the most popular therapies aimed at reducing suffering at the life and yet 
      the quantitative evidence supporting its effectiveness is mixed. Also, no study 
      has looked extensively at the qualitative literature. Objective: To describe the 
      experience of participating in DT for adults in end of life. Design: A scoping 
      review was conducted on the experience of DT among adults at their end of life. 
      We searched electronic databases between 2002 and 2020. Two reviewers 
      independently screened, extracted, and coded the data. They were analyzed using a 
      thematic framework approach. Results: Twelve articles were included in the final 
      analysis and were published between 2010 and 2019. The articles originated from 
      the United States (3), Canada (3), Poland (2), Australia (2), the United Kingdom 
      (2), Italy (1), and Germany (1). Two main categories of themes emerged from our 
      analysis: themes mentioned during the DT intervention and themes following the DT 
      intervention. The primary themes found during the DT intervention are discussions 
      relating to the end of life, reflection on life, and creating a life narrative. 
      The themes found following the DT intervention are that it opened a reflection on 
      the past, that this was a helpful intervention, and that it was difficult, but 
      important. Conclusions: Few qualitative studies assessed the experience of 
      participating in DT following the intervention. This gap in the literature could 
      explain the difficulties we currently have in understanding the effects of DT. 
      Future studies should aim to assess how the effects of DT are perceived by 
      patients after the intervention.

TI  - A scoping review of the literature pertaining to burnout and leadership in mental 
      health clinicians.
LID - 10.1108/LHS-04-2022-0043 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This paper aims to explore what is known in the literature about 
      leadership and burnout within mental health clinicians (MHC). 
      DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework was used to 
      conduct a systematised scoping review of three databases: PsycInfo, PubMed and 
      CINAHL. To ensure a broad scope of the literature, Google, Google Scholar and 
      three sources of grey literature were also searched. FINDINGS: In total 1,087 
      articles were identified and 36 were included in the final review, 23 of which 
      were cross-sectional and correlational studies. There is a lack of experimental 
      studies, longitudinal research and qualitative approaches. The literature 
      repeatedly demonstrated an association between leadership and burnout; 
      transformational-leadership style, good quality supervision, supportive 
      relationships, positive communication and fostering autonomy are areas of 
      interest. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Future research activity should aim 
      to follow the recommendations made in the literature; more experimental and 
      longitudinal approaches are needed to support practical application of the 
      findings. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: To the best of the author's knowledge there is no 
      other review which maps out the research pertaining to leadership and burnout 
      among MHC. These findings can be used to guide future research to ensure that 
      efforts are directed toward original, meaningful and practical ventures that will 
      add to the evidence base and benefit clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a recent rise in publications describing extracorporeal 
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO) education, the scope and quality of ECMO educational 
      research and curricular assessments have not previously been evaluated. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study are 1) to categorize published ECMO 
      educational scholarship according to Bloom's educational domains, learner groups, 
      and content delivery methods; 2) to assess ECMO educational scholarship quality; 
      and 3) to identify areas of focus for future curricular development and 
      educational research. METHODS: A multidisciplinary research team conducted a 
      scoping review of ECMO literature published between January 2009 and October 2021 
      using established frameworks. The Medical Education Research Study Quality 
      Instrument (MERSQI) was applied to assess quality. RESULTS: A total of 1,028 
      references were retrieved; 36 were selected for review. ECMO education studies 
      frequently targeted the cognitive domain (78%), with 17% of studies targeting the 
      psychomotor domain alone and 33% of studies targeting combinations of the 
      cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains. Thirty-three studies qualified for 
      MERSQI scoring, with a median score of 11 (interquartile range, 4; possible 
      range, 5-18). Simulation-based training was used in 97%, with 50% of studies 
      targeting physicians and one other discipline. CONCLUSION: ECMO education 
      frequently incorporates simulation and spans all domains of Bloom's taxonomy. 
      Overall, MERSQI scores for ECMO education studies are similar to those for other 
      simulation-based medical education studies. However, developing assessment tools 
      with multisource validity evidence and conducting multienvironment studies would 
      strengthen future work. The creation of a collaborative ECMO educational network 
      would increase standardization and reproducibility in ECMO training, ultimately 
      improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Cancer care and occupational therapy: A scoping review.
PG  - 172-194
LID - 10.1111/1440-1630.12633 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cancer can disrupt participation in everyday activities, suggesting 
      a place for occupational therapy; however, there is a need to articulate the 
      nature, scope and available evidence supporting the occupational therapy role 
      within cancer care. In this scoping review, we identify the breadth of practice 
      and evidence for occupational therapy in cancer care, across all stages of the 
      disease trajectory (diagnosis to palliation/survivorship) throughout the 
      lifespan. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched in June 2018, for 
      English language articles. Key words were: cancer care, OR oncolog*, OR oncologic 
      care, OR neoplasms, OR cancer survivors, OR terminal cancer, OR cancer 
      rehabilitation, AND occupational therap*. No date restrictions were imposed. 
      Included were: all styles of literature including grey literature, all types of 
      cancers and all age brackets. There were no restrictions on place of origin of 
      papers. Following the Arksey and O'Malley (2006; International Journal of Social 
      Research Methodology, 8: 19-32) framework for scoping reviews, the first author 
      screened titles and abstracts, and all three authors reviewed sets of the 
      included articles. Conflicts were discussed until consensus was reached. RESULTS: 
      After evaluating 305 titles and abstracts and 111 full-text articles, 89 papers 
      were retained. Articles included research studies (n = 43), reviews (n = 15), 
      grey literature (n = 16), practice analyses (n = 14) and an editorial (n = 1). 
      The occupational therapy roles described were diverse, but largely descriptive in 
      nature, with little evidence of outcomes from treatment. Furthermore, the 
      majority of papers addressed adult populations, with few considering children, 
      adolescents or young adults. Most papers focused on specific stages of the 
      disease, and none addressed the disease along its full trajectory. CONCLUSION: 
      Despite identifying a diverse range of occupational therapy roles in cancer care 
      throughout the disease trajectory and across the lifespan, the need for 
      professional discourse and research within our profession was highlighted. This 
      was particularly evident for adolescents and young adults with cancer.

AB  - Qualitative Geographic Information Systems (QGIS) represent an emerging 
      geospatial and qualitative approach to comprehensively understand health issues. 
      This scoping review gathers evidence from 38 articles to illuminate when and how 
      QGIS is used to address health issues. QGIS can contribute to recent 
      health-related studies focusing on determinants of health and health equity at 
      the community rather than individual level, highlight relationships between place 
      and health, and encourage participation from people and communities in 
      health-decision making. If more studies attempt to specify detailed data analysis 
      methods and develop ways to use rich contexts of qualitative data, QGIS can 
      provide greater scope for those working to solve health problems.

LID - e18310
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although both disaster management and disaster medicine have been 
      used for decades, their efficiency and effectiveness have been far from perfect. 
      One reason could be the lack of systematic utilization of modern technologies, 
      such as eHealth, in their operations. To address this issue, researchers' efforts 
      have led to the emergence of the disaster eHealth (DEH) field. DEH's main 
      objective is to systematically integrate eHealth technologies for health care 
      purposes within the disaster management cycle (DMC). OBJECTIVE: This study aims 
      to identify, map, and define the scope of DEH as a new area of research at the 
      intersection of disaster management, emergency medicine, and eHealth. METHODS: An 
      extensive scoping review using published materials was carried out in the areas 
      of disaster management, disaster medicine, and eHealth to identify the scope of 
      DEH. This review procedure was iterative and conducted in multiple scientific 
      databases in 2 rounds, one using controlled indexed terms and the other using 
      similar uncontrolled terms. In both rounds, the publications ranged from 1990 to 
      2016, and all the appropriate research studies discovered were considered, 
      regardless of their research design, methodology, and quality. Information 
      extracted from both rounds was thematically analyzed to define the DEH scope, and 
      the results were evaluated by the field experts through a Delphi method. RESULTS: 
      In both rounds of the research, searching for eHealth applications within DMC 
      yielded 404 relevant studies that showed eHealth applications in different 
      disaster types and disaster phases. These applications varied with respect to the 
      eHealth technology types, functions, services, and stakeholders. The results led 
      to the identification of the scope of DEH, including eHealth technologies and 
      their applications, services, and future developments that are applicable to 
      disasters as well as to related stakeholders. Reference to the elements of the 
      DEH scope indicates what, when, and how current eHealth technologies can be used 
      in the DMC. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive data gathering from multiple databases 
      offered a grounded method to define the DEH scope. This scope comprises concepts 
      related to DEH and the boundaries that define it. The scope identifies the 
      eHealth technologies relevant to DEH and the functions and services that can be 
      provided by these technologies. In addition, the scope tells us which groups can 
      use the provided services and functions and in which disaster types or phases. 
      DEH approaches could potentially improve the response to health care demands 
      before, during, and after disasters. DEH takes advantage of eHealth technologies 
      to facilitate DMC tasks and activities, enhance their efficiency and 
      effectiveness, and enhance health care delivery and provide more quality health 
      care services to the wider population regardless of their geographical location 
      or even disaster types and phases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgeons in resource-limited environments often provide care outside 
      the expected scope of current general surgery training. Geographically isolated 
      patients may be unwilling or unable to travel for specialty care. These same 
      patients also present with life-threatening emergencies beyond the typical 
      breadth of a general surgeon's practice, in hospitals with limited professional 
      and material support. This review characterizes the unique role of isolated 
      surgeons, so individual surgeons and health care organizations may focus 
      professional development resources more efficiently, with the ultimate goal of 
      improved patient care. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of the isolated 
      surgeon, reviewing 25 years of literature regarding isolated US civilian and 
      military surgeons. We examined emerging themes regarding the definition of an 
      isolated surgeon, the scope of surgical practice beyond current training norms, 
      and training gaps identified by surgeons in an isolated role. RESULTS: From 904 
      articles identified, we included 91 for final review. No prior definition exists 
      for the isolated surgeon, although multiple definitions describe rural surgeons, 
      patients, or hospitals; we propose an initial definition from consistent themes 
      in the literature. Isolated surgeons across varied practice settings consistently 
      performed relatively large volumes of cases of, and identified training gaps in, 
      orthopedic, obstetric and gynecologic, urologic, and vascular surgery 
      subspecialties. Life-threatening, "rare-but-real" cases in the above and 
      neurosurgical disciplines are uncommon, but consistent across practice settings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This review represents the largest examination of the isolated 
      surgeon in the current literature. Clarifying the identity, practice components, 
      and training gaps of the isolated surgeon represent the first step in formalizing 
      support for this small but critical group of surgeons and their patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low health literacy is prevalent and associated with suboptimal health 
      outcomes. In neurosurgery, social determinants of health are increasingly 
      recognized as factors underpinning outcomes, as well as access to and use of 
      care. We conducted a scoping review to delineate the scope of existing literature 
      regarding health literacy in the field and facilitate future research. METHODS: A 
      scoping review was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. 
      Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance. Studies meeting prespecified 
      inclusion criteria underwent full text review. Relevant data were extracted. 
      RESULTS: Of 5056 resultant articles, 57 manuscripts were included. Thirty-seven 
      studies (64.9%) investigated personal health literacy, while the remaining 20 
      (35.1%) investigated organizational health literacy. Domains of health literacy 
      investigated were science (36, 63.2%), fundamental (20, 35.1%), and civic (1, 
      1.7%). No studies investigated numeracy. Recall among patients after discussions 
      with neurosurgeons is low. Patient perspectives are often erroneous. Patient 
      informational needs are often unmet. Written patient educational materials are 
      written at a level too complex for the average patients. Videos are mostly of 
      poor quality. Multimodal audiovisual interventions, eBooks, models, and virtual 
      reality are shown to be effective methods for promoting recall. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Studies examining health literacy in neurosurgery primarily focus on the topic 
      indirectly, most often via written educational materials and recall after 
      educational interventions. Increasing awareness of health literacy among 
      neurosurgeons, assessing health literacy, and incorporating health 
      literacy-informed counseling approaches are warranted to improve patient care.

TI  - A scoping review of risk-stratified bowel screening: current evidence, future 
      directions.
PG  - 653-685
LID - 10.1007/s10552-022-01568-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In this scoping review, we examined the international literature on 
      risk-stratified bowel screening to develop recommendations for future research, 
      practice and policy. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched from 
      inception to 18 October 2021: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane 
      Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials. Forward and backwards citation searches were also undertaken. All 
      relevant literature were included. RESULTS: After de-deduplication, 3,629 records 
      remained. 3,416 were excluded at the title/abstract screening stage. A further 
      111 were excluded at full-text screening stage. In total, 102 unique studies were 
      included. Results showed that risk-stratified bowel screening programmes can 
      potentially improve diagnostic performance, but there is a lack of information on 
      longer-term outcomes. Risk models do appear to show promise in refining existing 
      risk stratification guidelines but most were not externally validated and less 
      than half achieved good discriminatory power. Risk assessment tools in primary 
      care have the potential for high levels of acceptability and uptake, and 
      therefore, could form an important component of future risk-stratified bowel 
      screening programmes, but sometimes the screening recommendations were not 
      adhered to by the patient or healthcare provider. The review identified important 
      knowledge gaps, most notably in the area of organisation of screening services 
      due to few pilots, and what risk stratification might mean for inequalities. 
      CONCLUSION: We recommend that future research focuses on what organisational 
      challenges risk-stratified bowel screening may face and a consideration of 
      inequalities in any changes to organised bowel screening programmes.

TI  - Overview of registries for anaphylaxis: a scoping review.
PG  - 2656-2696
LID - 10.11124/JBIES-21-00182 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to describe the scope and operational features of 
      anaphylaxis registries, and to assess their contribution to improving knowledge 
      of anaphylaxis and care of patients who experience anaphylaxis by measuring their 
      research output. INTRODUCTION: Structured data collection and reporting systems, 
      such as registries, are needed to better understand the burden of anaphylaxis and 
      to protect the growing number of patients with severe allergy. There is a need to 
      characterize current anaphylaxis registries to identify their value in 
      anaphylaxis surveillance, management, and research. Information synthesized in 
      this review will provide knowledge on benefits and gaps in current registries, 
      which may inform the implementation and global standardization of future 
      anaphylaxis reporting systems. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review considered 
      literature describing registries worldwide that enroll patients who have 
      experienced anaphylaxis. Published and gray literature sources were included if 
      they described the scope and operational features of anaphylaxis registries. 
      METHODS: This review followed the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. Embase, 
      MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched for relevant articles. Identified 
      keywords and index terms were adapted for searches of gray literature sources, 
      using Google advanced search functions. Only full-text studies in English were 
      considered for inclusion. Two independent reviewers conducted title and abstract 
      screening and those that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. The 
      full text of potentially relevant articles were retrieved; full-text screening 
      and data extraction were also conducted by two independent reviewers. Any 
      discrepancies were resolved through discussion or with a third reviewer. Tables 
      and a narrative summary were used to describe and compare the scope and features 
      (eg, inclusion criteria, patient demographics, clinical symptoms) of the 
      identified anaphylaxis registries, and to outline their output to assess their 
      contribution to research and clinical practice for anaphylaxis. RESULTS: A total 
      of 77 full-text publications and eight gray literature sources were used to 
      extract data. The literature search identified 19 anaphylaxis registries, with 
      sites in 28 countries including Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United 
      States, Korea, and Australia. The main purposes of the identified registries were 
      to collect clinical data for research; provide clinical support tools to improve 
      patient care; and operate as allergen surveillance systems to protect the wider 
      community with allergies. Differences in inclusion and health care settings 
      exist, with 11 collecting data on anaphylaxis of any cause, two on food reactions 
      alone, three on fatal anaphylaxis, one on perioperative anaphylaxis, and two on 
      allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis). Five registries enroll cases in 
      allergy centers, five in hospital settings, one in schools, and others target a 
      combination of general practitioners, specialists in emergency departments, and 
      other relevant hospital departments and allergy outpatient clinics. Only three 
      registries operate under a mandatory framework. A total of 57 publications were 
      considered research outputs from registries. All registries except two have 
      published studies from collected data, with the greatest number of articles 
      published from 2019 to the present. Publications mostly addressed questions 
      regarding demographic profile, causes and cofactors, severity, fatal reactions, 
      and gaps in management. CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrated that anaphylaxis 
      registries differ in their scope and operation, having been established for 
      different purposes. Importantly, registries have contributed significantly to 
      research, which has highlighted gaps in anaphylaxis management, provoking 
      allergens, and informed targets for prevention for severe and fatal events. 
      Beyond this, registries relay information about anaphylaxis to clinicians and 
      regulatory bodies to improve patient care and protect the community. The ability 
      to link registry data with other health datasets, standardization of data across 
      registries, and incorporation of clinical care indicators to promote quality 
      health care across the health system represent important targets for future 
      systems.

TI  - Disinvestment in healthcare: a scoping review of systematic reviews.
PG  - e69
LID - 10.1017/S0266462322000514 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Disinvestment from low value health technologies is growing globally. 
      Diverse evidence gathering and assessment methods were used to implement 
      disinvestment initiatives, however, less than half of the empirical studies 
      report reduced use of the low-value services. This scoping review aimed to 
      synthesize the information from available reviews on the concepts and purposes of 
      disinvestment in healthcare, the approaches and methods used, the role of 
      stakeholders and facilitators and barriers in its implementation. METHODS: This 
      scoping review was guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence 
      Synthesis and PRISMA statement for scoping review. Published reviews on 
      disinvestment were identified from scientific databases including health 
      technology assessment (HTA) Web sites using the terms "disinvestment," "health 
      technology reassessment," and "healthcare." The data obtained was synthesized 
      narratively to identify similarities and differences across the approaches based 
      on the prespecified categories. RESULTS: Seventeen reviews were included with 
      thirty-four initiatives identified across sixteen countries at various levels of 
      implementation and responsible agencies for the activities. Two most used methods 
      to facilitate disinvestment decisions are Programme Budgeting and Marginal 
      Analysis (PBMA) and HTA. Stakeholder involvement is the most important aspect to 
      be addressed, as it acts as both facilitator and barrier in disinvestment 
      initiatives implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Disinvestment programs have been 
      implemented at multilevel, involving multistakeholders and using multiple methods 
      such as PBMA and HTA. However, there is a lack of clarity on the additional 
      dimensions of technical analysis related to these tools. Further research could 
      focus on technology optimization in healthcare as part of overall health 
      technology management.

TI  - Trends in guideline implementation: an updated scoping review.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/s13012-022-01223-6 [doi]
LID - 50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines aim to support evidence-informed practice but are 
      inconsistently used without implementation strategies. Our prior scoping review 
      revealed that guideline implementation interventions were not selected and 
      tailored based on processes known to enhance guideline uptake and impact. The 
      purpose of this study was to update the prior scoping review. METHODS: We 
      searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of 
      Systematic Reviews for studies published from 2014 to January 2021 that evaluated 
      guideline implementation interventions. We screened studies in triplicate and 
      extracted data in duplicate. We reported study and intervention characteristics 
      and studies that achieved impact with summary statistics. RESULTS: We included 
      118 studies that implemented guidelines on 16 clinical topics. With regard to 
      implementation planning, 21% of studies referred to theories or frameworks, 50% 
      pre-identified implementation barriers, and 36% engaged stakeholders in selecting 
      or tailoring interventions. Studies that employed frameworks (n=25) most often 
      used the theoretical domains framework (28%) or social cognitive theory (28%). 
      Those that pre-identified barriers (n=59) most often consulted literature (60%). 
      Those that engaged stakeholders (n=42) most often consulted healthcare 
      professionals (79%). Common interventions included educating professionals about 
      guidelines (44%) and information systems/technology (41%). Most studies employed 
      multi-faceted interventions (75%). A total of 97 (82%) studies achieved impact 
      (improvements in one or more reported outcomes) including 10 (40% of 25) studies 
      that employed frameworks, 28 (47.45% of 59) studies that pre-identified barriers, 
      22 (52.38% of 42) studies that engaged stakeholders, and 21 (70% of 30) studies 
      that employed single interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to our prior review, 
      this review found that more studies used processes to select and tailor 
      interventions, and a wider array of types of interventions across the Mazza 
      taxonomy. Given that most studies achieved impact, this might reinforce the need 
      for implementation planning. However, even studies that did not plan 
      implementation achieved impact. Similarly, even single interventions achieved 
      impact. Thus, a future systematic review based on this data is warranted to 
      establish if the use of frameworks, barrier identification, stakeholder 
      engagement, and multi-faceted interventions are associated with impact. TRIAL

TI  - A Scoping Review of Digital Health Interventions to Promote Healthy Romantic 
      Relationships in Adolescents.
LID - 10.1007/s11121-022-01421-0 [doi]
AB  - Despite a robust field of study in healthy romantic relationship education and 
      risk prevention interventions that employ traditional forms of delivery, the 
      field of digital health interventions (DHIs) in healthy relationship programming 
      for adolescents remains undefined. The purpose of this scoping review was to 
      summarize the scope of published research in DHIs that promote healthy romantic 
      relationships in adolescents. We conducted database searches, 2000-2022; hand 
      searches; reference list and literature review searches, and emailed study 
      authors to identify articles. Included were experimental, development, and 
      feasibility studies. We summarized features of selected studies and their healthy 
      relationship aims/components and identified patterns of emphasis and areas of 
      future need. Sixteen publications describing 15 unique DHIs were reviewed with 
      interventions developed and or trialed in 11 countries. We identified 10 
      web-based or downloadable applications, four serious game applications, one 
      video-voice program, and one social media-based program. DHIs focused on 
      improving knowledge/attitudes/skills of healthy adolescent romantic relationships 
      directly or through prevention-focused programs. Interventions that measured 
      outcomes found small effects, primarily in healthy romantic relationship 
      communication skills. DHIs offer unique opportunities to provide user-responsive 
      and culturally specified programming for adolescents and to involve adolescents 
      themselves in processes of program design, development, and evaluation. Further 
      research is warranted to define relevant outcomes for adolescents and validated 
      measures to evaluate them. Future research might seek to address the social 
      ecology of adolescent romantic relationships beyond the individual and 
      interpersonal and explore combinations of virtual and adult-moderated in-person 
      delivery to ensure youth are adequately supported.

TI  - A scoping review of pharmacy participation in dental and oral health care.
PG  - 339-349
LID - 10.1111/cdoe.12651 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the scope of dental and oral health care (DOHC) provided 
      by the pharmacy profession and associated outcomes, and attitudes of pharmacy 
      staff and other key stakeholders about pharmacy involvement in this context. 
      METHODS: A scoping review of full-text articles describing outcomes related to 
      pharmacy staff/student involvement in, knowledge of or attitudes towards DOHC in 
      any setting, and stakeholder perspectives was conducted. Articles written in 
      English were searched for using PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, International 
      Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Education Resources Information Centre, Web of Science, 
      Google Scholar, and ProQuest for Dissertations and Theses. No date restrictions 
      were used. Key outcomes were mapped: role and practice, knowledge and attitudes, 
      and training and education. RESULTS: Seventy studies met the inclusion criteria: 
      49 were conducted in developed countries; 60 were quantitative in design; and 38 
      involved community pharmacy settings only. Pharmacists and pharmacy support staff 
      commonly managed DOHC inquiries (n = 13), including the provision of advice and 
      products with or without a further referral. Integrated pharmacist-led services 
      in dental settings (n = 4) showed improved prescribing and quality use of 
      medicines but low community pharmacy referrals were identified in studies 
      involving mystery shoppers with potential oral cancer (n = 7). DOHC promotion 
      programmes delivered by pharmacy staff and collaborations with dentists were 
      limited. There was interest from the pharmacy profession for a role in DOHC; 
      however, knowledge gaps were reported and needs for further training identified. 
      Consumer participant DOHC outcomes were not reported. CONCLUSIONS: Community 
      pharmacists and pharmacy staff were interested in an expanded role in DOHC; 
      however, this scoping review identified lack of knowledge and sub-optimal 
      practice as potential barriers. Research on development, implementation and 
      evaluation of DOHC-related services and practice by pharmacy staff was scarce. 
      Further evidence of consumer-related oral health outcomes and their perceptions 
      of the role of pharmacy is needed.

TI  - Ophthalmology training in sub-Saharan Africa: a scoping review.
PG  - 1066-1083
LID - 10.1038/s41433-020-01335-7 [doi]
AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 12% of the global population, and 4.3 million are 
      blind and over 15 million are visually impaired. There are only 2.5 
      ophthalmologists per million people in SSA. Training of ophthalmologists is 
      critical. We designed a systematic literature review protocol, searched MEDLINE 
      Ovid and Embase OVID on 1 August 2019 and limited these searches to the year 2000 
      onwards. We also searched Google Scholar and websites of ophthalmic institutions 
      for additional information. We include a total of 49 references in this review 
      and used a narrative approach to synthesise the results. There are 56 training 
      institutions for ophthalmologists in eleven Anglophone, eleven Francophone, and 
      two Lusophone SSA countries. The median duration of ophthalmology training 
      programmes was 4 years. Most curricula have been regionally standardised. 
      National, regional and international collaborations are a key feature to 
      ophthalmology training in more than half of ophthalmology training programmes. 
      There is a drive, although perhaps not always evidence-based, for 
      sub-specialisation in the region. Available published scientific data on 
      ophthalmic medical and surgical training in SSA is sparse, especially for 
      Francophone and Lusophone countries. However, through a broad scoping review 
      strategy it has been possible to obtain a valuable and detailed view of 
      ophthalmology training in SSA. Training of ophthalmologists is a complex and 
      multi-faceted task. There are challenges in appropriate selection, capacity, and 
      funding of available training institutions. Numerous learning outcomes demand 
      curriculum, time, faculty, support, and appropriate assessment. There are 
      opportunities provided by modern training approaches. Partnership is key.

TI  - Post-traumatic growth after cancer: a scoping review of qualitative research.
PG  - 7013-7027
LID - 10.1007/s00520-021-06253-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Interest is growing in post-traumatic growth (PTG) after cancer 
      prompted, in part, by observations of positive associations with health-related 
      quality of life. Qualitative research provides valuable insight into survivors' 
      experiences. We conducted a scoping review of qualitative evidence on PTG in 
      cancer, determining the number, nature, range and scope of studies, and gaps in 
      the literature. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, Web 
      of Science, and PsycINFO for qualitative research exploring positive changes 
      after cancer published from 1996. From eligible studies, we extracted: terms used 
      for PTG; design, methodological orientation, and techniques, and participant 
      characteristics. Using descriptive mapping, we explored whether study findings 
      fit within Tedeschi and Calhoun's PTG framework, and evidence for unique positive 
      changes post-cancer. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were eligible. Cancer sites 
      included were: breast, 14; mixed, 6; haematological, 4; head and neck cancer, 2; 
      bone, 1, and testis, 1. Multiple studies were conducted in: the USA (12), 
      Australia (3), Iran (2), and the UK (2). Twenty-three studies collected data 
      using individual interviews (21) or focus groups (2). Definitions of PTG varied. 
      Studies largely focused on descriptive accounts of PTG. Findings mapped onto 
      existing PTG dimensions; health behaviour changes were often reported, under 'new 
      possibilities'. CONCLUSIONS: A range of PTG outcomes can occur after cancer. 
      Positive health behaviour changes warrant further exploration. Future research 
      should include more diverse patient populations, collect longitudinal data, and 
      focus on pathways towards positive changes.

LID - e28
AB  - This is the second article in a series of two about occupational therapy and 
      primary care. The first article (see PH&RD….) described the position of the 
      profession in primary care across Europe and the scope of the profession. In this 
      article the broad scope of the profession is illustrated with various examples of 
      occupational therapy interventions. The interventions are identified by means of 
      a literature search. A questionnaire (the questionnaire is available by mailing 
      the author) was sent out to experts across Europe which resulted in both relevant 
      literature and evidence-based examples. The evidence level of these examples 
      differs from expert opinion (5), case series (4), case-controlled studies (3), 
      cohort studies (2) and randomized-control trial (1). The article ends with 
      recommendations in four areas how to develop, establish or strengthen the 
      profession in primary care.

TI  - Evaluating antenatal breastmilk expression outcomes: a scoping review.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s13006-021-00371-7 [doi]
LID - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antenatal breastmilk expression (aBME) is recommended by some 
      healthcare providers to improve lactation, breastfeeding, and newborn outcomes, 
      particularly for women with diabetes as they face unique challenges with 
      breastfeeding. However, there is limited evidence of the potential harms and 
      benefits of this practice. Our objective was to conduct a scoping review to map 
      the literature describing maternal and newborn outcomes of aBME. METHODS: We 
      searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
      British Library E-Theses Online Services (EThOS) database, OpenGrey, and Clinical 
      trials.gov from inception to January 2020. Studies in English that reported on 
      the effect of aBME on maternal and newborn outcomes, and the experiences of women 
      who have engaged in the practice were included for screening. Titles, abstracts, 
      and full-text articles were screened by two independent reviewers. A critical 
      appraisal and clinical consultation were conducted. Key findings were extracted 
      and summarized. RESULTS: We screened 659 studies and 20 met the inclusion 
      criteria. The majority of included studies (n = 11, 55.0%) were published after 
      2015, and seven (35.0%) originated from Australia. Ten (50.0%) studies provided 
      data on high-risk obstetrical populations, including those with diabetes (n = 8), 
      overweight or obesity (n = 1), and preeclampsia (n = 1). Commonly reported 
      outcomes included breastfeeding status at discharge or follow-up, mode of 
      delivery, newborn blood glucose, and time to establishing full lactation. 
      Maternal experiences were related to challenges with aBME, confidence and 
      mastery, perceived impact, security and altruism, learning and resources, and 
      physical symptoms as a result of aBME. The critical appraisal demonstrated 
      limited high-quality evidence surrounding aBME. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      demonstrate increasing interest in the safety, efficacy, and acceptability of 
      aBME. Existing studies are heterogenous with variable research questions, 
      outcomes, study designs, and methodology. The recommendations made in this review 
      can be used to help inform  future studies evaluating aBME.

TI  - Scoping Review of Self-Advocacy Education Interventions to Improve Care.
PG  - 50-56
LID - 10.1177/1539449219860583 [doi]
AB  - Self-advocacy is a client's ability to represent one's interests when managing 
      disease or disability. Self-advocacy may increase one's ability to seek, 
      evaluate, and use information to promote health, yet little is known about the 
      role of occupational therapy in promoting self-advocacy. This scoping review aims 
      to identify interventions within occupational therapists' scope of practice to 
      improve self-advocacy. A literature search was conducted through Academic Search 
      Complete to identify interventions within the scope of occupational therapy that 
      promote self-advocacy. All levels of evidence were included, and articles were 
      reviewed for inclusion by two authors. Included articles were charted for level 
      of evidence, objectives, participants, and results. Fourteen articles met the 
      criteria. Interventions included interactive multimedia interventions, peer-led 
      educational groups, writing interventions, job counseling and advocacy, and 
      disease-specific advocacy programs. Occupational therapists are well-equipped to 
      intervene and promote self-advocacy through workplace modification, utilizing 
      assistive technologies, and facilitating peer-led educational groups.

TI  - The role of pharmacists in opioid stewardship: A scoping review.
PG  - 2714-2747
LID - S1551-7411(21)00235-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.sapharm.2021.06.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The opioid epidemic is an international public health concern. 
      Pharmacists are in a strategic position to promote and implement effective opioid 
      stewardship due to both their central role on health care teams and frequent 
      interaction with patients. Despite this integral role, pharmacists do not have 
      harmonized scopes of practice in opioid stewardship. OBJECTIVES: This scoping 
      review was conducted to identify and critically review the role of pharmacists in 
      opioid stewardship and identify future areas of study. METHODS: The scoping 
      review was conducted according to the methodological framework proposed by Arksey 
      and O'Malley, which was further modified by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Six 
      databases were searched for original, peer-reviewed research; PubMed (MEDLINE), 
      Ovid Embase, Ovid International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Scopus, Cochrane 
      Library, and APA PsycInfo. RESULTS: In 92% of the included studies (n = 77), 
      opioid stewardship interventions led by either a pharmacist or in an 
      interdisciplinary team resulted in improvements in at least one outcome measure, 
      with education and medication therapy adjustments being the most predominant 
      activities. Other areas supported by evidence include community stakeholder 
      education, policy and guideline setting, and risk assessment. CONCLUSION: This 
      scoping review provides valuable insight into the various roles pharmacists can 
      have in opioid stewardship. The findings from this review identified opioid 
      stewardship activities that can make significant contributions towards reducing 
      the impact of the opioid crisis. This review informs future research and has the 
      potential to influence pharmacy practice on a national and international scale.

TI  - Scoping review - What do we know about Aboriginal peoples' use of dose 
      administration aids?
PG  - 117-127
LID - 10.1002/hpja.577 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: This paper aims to report findings of a scoping review which 
      mapped and summarised available literature regarding Aboriginal peoples' use of 
      Dose Administration Aids (DAAs) for improved medication management. Aboriginal 
      and Torres Strait Islander peoples have higher rates of chronic disease than 
      other Australians. This leads to increased numbers of prescribed medications and 
      complex medication taking regimens. The Australian Government and Pharmacy Bodies 
      provide programs for Aboriginal peoples with chronic conditions, including 
      programs supporting access to DAAs to improve medication adherence. METHODS: The 
      search strings used included three key concepts: Indigeneity; DAAs and outcomes. 
      PubMed, Medline via Ovid and the grey literature were searched. RESULTS: After 
      removal of duplicates, 426 papers were screened by title and abstract for 
      inclusion. A further 407 papers were then excluded leaving a total of nineteen 
      papers included in the review. Only three of these papers included all three 
      concepts in the search criteria, and none of these were empirical studies. 
      CONCLUSION: The lack of studies found in this review support the requirement for 
      empirical research regarding the effects of DAAs on medication taking behaviours 
      of Aboriginal people, and the programs that provide them. SO WHAT?: The 
      Australian Government funds programs that provides access to DAAs as a method of 
      improving medication taking behaviours. But what do we really know about DAAs and 
      if or how they assist in this goal? This review scopes out what is known, in 
      order to direct studies that will answer this question.

TI  - Home-based nursing care competencies: A scoping review.
LID - 10.1111/jocn.16169 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify and consolidate the available evidence about 
      nursing-related competencies for home-based care. BACKGROUND: Over recent years, 
      the demand for home-based nursing care has increased because of the need to meet 
      the increasing need for chronic disease care to be delivered in patients' homes. 
      However, knowledge is lacking about the expected competencies for home-based care 
      nurses. DESIGN: A scoping review was conducted in accordance with Arksey and 
      O'Malley's six-step scoping review framework and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The 
      review identified literature using five electronic databases (CINAHL, PubMed, 
      Embase, Cochrane and Scopus) and a hand search for grey literature in relevant 
      home-based care journals and online searches. Key search terms and inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria were used as strategies to identify relevant articles. 
      RESULTS: Sixty-four articles were eligible for inclusion. Mapping and narrative 
      synthesis of 116 elements related to home-based nursing care competencies 
      identified the following 10 competencies: (1) care assessments; (2) performance 
      of nursing procedures; (3) management of health conditions; (4) critical thinking 
      and problem-solving skills; (5) interpersonal relationships and communication; 
      (6) interdisciplinary collaboration; (7) leadership and resource management; (8) 
      professional development; (9) technological literacy; (10) quality and safety. 
      CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review provides insight into 
      current knowledge about home-based nursing care competencies. These competencies 
      could be used to evaluate nurses' competence level for home-based care or for 
      development of appropriate professional education. The review also outlines the 
      scope of nursing practice in home-based care, which provides support for some 
      form of standardisation of home-based nursing care expectations across various 
      stakeholders.

      experiencing homelessness, and the influence on access to healthcare. DESIGN: A 
      scoping review. DATA SOURCES: On 20 November 2020, the following databases were 
      searched: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Scopus. REVIEW METHODS: Included 
      studies focused on people experiencing homelessness aged 18 years and over, 
      nurse-led services in any setting and described the nursing scope of practice. 
      Studies were peer-reviewed primary research, published in English from the year 
      2000. Three authors performed quality appraisals using the mixed methods 
      assessment tool. Results were synthesized and discussed narratively and reported 
      according to the PRISMA-ScR 2020 Statement. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were 
      included from the United States (n = 9), Australia (n = 4), United Kingdom 
      (n = 4) and Canada (n = 2). The total participant sample size was n = 6303. 
      Studies focused on registered nurses (n = 10), nurse practitioners (n = 5) or 
      both (n = 4), in outpatient or community settings. The nursing scope of practice 
      was broad and covered a range of skills, knowledge and attributes. Key skills 
      identified include assessment and procedural skills, client support and health 
      education. Key attributes were a trauma-informed approach and building trust 
      through communication. Important knowledge included understanding the impact of 
      homelessness, knowledge of available services and the capacity to undertake 
      holistic assessments. Findings suggest that nurse-led care facilitated access to 
      healthcare through building trust and supporting clients to access services. 
      CONCLUSION: Optimized nursing scope of practice can facilitate access to 
      healthcare for people experiencing homelessness. Key factors in enabling this 
      include autonomy in nursing practice, organizational support and education. 
      IMPACT: The broad range of skills, knowledge and attributes reported provide a 
      foundation from which to design an educational framework to optimize the nursing 
      scope of practice, thereby increasing access to healthcare for people 
      experiencing homelessness.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To count and describe the elements that overlap (ie, present in two or 
      more) and diverge between models and frameworks of patient engagement in health 
      services research. Our specific research question was 'what are the elements that 
      underlie models and frameworks of patient engagement in health services 
      research?' DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: On 6-7 July 2021, we searched 
      six electronic databases (ie, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
      Joanna Briggs Institute Evidence Based Practice Database, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and 
      Scopus) and Google Scholar for published literature, and ProQuest Dissertations & 
      Theses, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Google, and key agencies' websites 
      for unpublished (ie, grey) literature, with no date restrictions. These searches 
      were supplemented by snowball sampling. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included 
      published and unpublished literature that presented (a) models or frameworks (b) 
      of patient engagement (c) in health services research. We excluded articles 
      unavailable as full text or not written in English. DATA EXTRACTION AND 
      SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data from included articles using 
      an a priori developed standardised form. Data were synthesised using both 
      quantitative (ie, counts) and qualitative (ie, mapping) analyses. RESULTS: We 
      identified a total of 8069 articles and ultimately included 14 models and 
      frameworks in the review. These models and frameworks were comprised of 18 
      overlapping and 57 diverging elements, that were organised into six conceptual 
      categories (ie, principles, foundational components, contexts, actions, levels 
      and outcomes) and spanned intrapersonal, interpersonal, process, environmental, 
      and health systems and outcomes domains. CONCLUSIONS: There is little overlap 
      between the elements that comprise existing models and frameworks of patient 
      engagement in health services research. Those seeking to apply these models and 
      frameworks should consider the 'fit' of each element, by conceptual category and 
      domain, within the context of their study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective for this manuscript is two-fold: determine the scope of 
      clinical rehabilitation research involving burn-injured persons and assess 
      whether research outcomes include function, return to needed, and desirable 
      routines. Has this research addressed rehabilitation needs of the burn injured? 
      METHODS: We performed a scoping review of literature (1990-2016) using the method 
      of Arksey and O'Malley. Search terms included "rehabilitation", "function", "burn 
      injury" and "work". Two independent reviewers identified articles that met 
      criteria for abstract and full review. Variables of interest were counts of the 
      number of intervention studies, studies performed in outpatient 
      settings/inpatient settings, or both; count of the distribution of outcome 
      measures that included impairment, function, participation, return to prior roles 
      and percent of burns rehabilitation publications as a function of total 
      rehabilitation articles published. RESULTS: Sixty-four articles were selected for 
      review and 22 employed an intervention. Nine articles were intervention trials 
      that used functional measures. Of the 22 intervention trials 3 (14%) were 
      performed while subjects were inpatients, 9 (41%) while they were outpatients, 
      and 10 (45%) while they were both. There were 67 articles that met inclusion for 
      work-related studies. Fourteen were intervention trials, 9 utilized functional 
      outcomes and 5 used impairment outcomes exclusively. Less than 1% of clinical 
      rehabilitation research addresses burns injury and <1% of the randomized trials 
      in rehabilitation relates to burn injury CONCLUSIONS: There are few studies, few 
      intervention trials and among these, very few that use function or return to 
      community based activity as outcomes for people with burn injury.

TI  - Irritant-Induced Chronic Cough Triggers: A Scoping Review and Clinical Checklist.
PG  - 1261-1291
LID - 10.1044/2021_AJSLP-20-00362 [doi]
AB  - Purpose The primary aim of this review was to identify environmental irritants 
      known to trigger chronic cough through the life span and develop a comprehensive 
      clinically useful irritant checklist. Method A scoping review was conducted using 
      the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Extension 
      for Scoping Reviews, checklist, and explanation. English-language, full-text 
      resources were identified through Medline, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, 
      and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. Results A total of 1,072 sources 
      were retrieved; of these, 109 were duplicates. Titles of abstracts of 963 
      articles were screened, with 295 selected for full-text review. Using the 
      exclusion and inclusion criteria listed, 236 articles were considered eligible 
      and 214 different triggers were identified. Triggers were identified from North 
      America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Occupational exposures were also 
      delineated. Conclusions A clinically useful checklist of both frequently 
      encountered triggers and idiosyncratic or rare triggers was developed. The 
      clinical checklist provides a unique contribution to streamline and standardize 
      clinical assessment of irritant-induced chronic cough. The international scope of 
      this review extends the usefulness of the clinical checklist to clinicians on 
      most continents.

LID - 234
AB  - BACKGROUND: This scoping review aims to identify, review and characterize the 
      published recommendations to conduct and/or to report a systematic review in 
      medical interventions area. METHODS: A search was carried out in PubMed, EMBASE 
      and Cochrane Library databases, using systematic reviews search filters. The 
      search comprises all recommendations to conduct and/or report a systematic 
      review. Data on methods were extracted from each recommendation. A descriptive 
      analysis was performed. RESULTS: Eighty-three recommendations were identified. 
      Approximately 60% of retrieved references were published in the last 6 years. 
      Recommendations to both conduct and report a systematic review were issued in 47% 
      studies. The guidance presented in each recommendation to conduct and/ or report 
      a systematic review varied. Almost 96% of the recommendations offer guidance on 
      systematic review methods section. The need and time for updating was only 
      recommended in 29% of recommendations. Forty percent of recommendations endorsed 
      their methods to any subject related to medical interventions. Half of the 
      studies did not specify the design of studies to be included in a systematic 
      review. CONCLUSIONS: Several recommendations to conduct and/or report a 
      systematic review were published and offered different guidance. Further research 
      on the impact of such heterogeneity can improve systematic reviews quality.

TI  - A Scoping Review of Physical Activity in People With Lower-Limb Loss: 10,000 
      Steps Per Day?
LID - pzab115 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ptj/pzab115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: After amputation, people with lower-limb loss (PLL) face challenges to 
      regain their previous physical activity level. Assessing the scope of evidence 
      regarding physical activity in PLL can identify sources of evidence and gaps 
      within the literature that can influence amputation-related research, outcome 
      assessment choices, and wellness activities. The purpose of this scoping review 
      was to map the evidence regarding steps per day as a physical activity measure 
      for PLL. Specific aims were to (1) identify research designs, (2) catalog 
      population subgroups, (3) document steps per day measurement methods, and (4) 
      provide descriptive data for steps per day in PLL. METHODS: The MEDLINE, CINAHL, 
      Embase, Web of Science, and AMED databases; and the Journal of Prosthetics and 
      Orthotics archive were searched without language or time limits. Exclusion 
      criteria included no PLL subjects, not peer-reviewed, and no direct step count 
      measure. Inclusion criteria allowed any sample size, nonprosthetic use, and 
      self-reported step count. As a scoping review, only descriptive statistics were 
      compiled, and no methodologic quality assessment was performed. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-one articles using crossover (8), cohort (4), cross-section (8), and 
      case-study (1) designs were included that reported accelerometer (19) or 
      pedometer (2) data. Studies often mixed amputation etiologies (15/21) and most 
      (13/21) excluded transfemoral amputations. Studies primarily examined people with 
      transtibial amputations (81.2%) and people at independent community walking 
      levels (Medicare functional classifications: K3 = 49.2%, K4 = 36.3%). All 21 
      studies had fewer than 100 participants, and overall included 515 subjects (343, 
      66.6% male), mean (SD) age 53.2 (22.1) years. Mean (SD) number of pooled steps 
      per day for PLL was 5087 (2998): 5929 (3047) for transtibial amputations and 3553 
      (2030) for transfemoral amputations. CONCLUSIONS: Most PLL have low activity 
      levels compared with the 10,000 steps per day generally recommended or 6000 
      common in people with diabetes. Research with larger samples, defined subgroups, 
      and data along the recovery continuum would enhance knowledge of physical 
      activity level in PLL. IMPACT: This scoping review has identified gaps in the 
      research related to steps per day as a measure of physical activity in people 
      with lower-limb loss to guide future research. LAY SUMMARY: People with 
      lower-limb loss take fewer steps per day than suggested for general health. 
      Increasing steps per day may be a useful goal for this population, and this study 
      is a first step in improving knowledge of physical activity levels in people with 
      lower-limb loss.

TI  - Optimization of home care nurses in Canada: A scoping review.
PG  - e604-e621
LID - 10.1111/hsc.12797 [doi]
AB  - Nurses are among the largest providers of home care services thus optimisation of 
      this workforce can positively influence client outcomes. This scoping review maps 
      existing Canadian literature on factors influencing the optimisation of home care 
      nurses (HCNs). Arskey and O'Malley's five stages for scoping literature reviews 
      were followed. Populations of interest included Registered Nurses, 
      Registered/Licensed Practical Nurses, Registered Nursing Assistants, Advanced 
      Practice Nurses, Nurse Practitioners and Clinical Nurse Specialists. 
      Interventions included any nurse(s), organisational and system interventions 
      focused on optimising home care nursing. Papers were included if published 
      between January 1, 2002 up to May 15, 2015. The review included 127 papers, 
      including 94 studies, 16 descriptive papers, 6 position papers, 4 discussion 
      papers, 3 policy papers, 2 literature reviews and 2 other. Optimisation factors 
      were categorised under seven domains: Continuity of Care/Care; Staffing Mix and 
      Staffing Levels; Professional Development; Quality Practice Environments; 
      Intra-professional and Inter-professional and Inter-sectoral Collaboration; 
      Enhancing Scope of Practice: and, Appropriate Use of Technology. Fragmentation 
      and underfunding of the home care sector and resultant service cuts negatively 
      impact optimisation. Given the fiscal climate, optimising the existing workforce 
      is essential to support effective and efficient care delivery models. Many 
      factors are inter-related and have synergistic impacts (e.g., recruitment and 
      retention, compensation and benefits, professional development supports, staffing 
      mix and levels, workload management and the use of technology). Quality practice 
      environments facilitate optimal practice by maximixing human resources and 
      supporting workforce stability. Role clarity and leadership supports foster more 
      effective interprofessional team functioning that leverages expertise and 
      enhances patient outcomes. Results inform employers, policy makers and relevant 
      associations regarding barriers and enablers that influence the optimisation of 
      home care nursing in nursing, intra- and inter-professional and 
      inter-organisational contexts.

TI  - A scoping review of return to work decision-making and experiences of breast 
      cancer survivors in Korea.
PG  - 1741-1751
LID - 10.1007/s00520-020-05817-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Return to work (RTW) is an important component of cancer survivorship 
      for individual rehabilitation and economic development. The focus of prior 
      research on cancer survivor RTW has generally been on Western and general cancer 
      populations. There is a need to examine the existing research on RTW decisions 
      and experiences in Korean breast cancer survivors (BCS). METHODS: This scoping 
      review followed the framework of Arksey and O'Malley, which consisted of 
      identifying the research question, discovering and selecting studies, charting 
      data, analyzing results, and incorporating expert consultations. Quality 
      assessments and a thematic map were included. RESULTS: Out of 863 original 
      articles found in the literature search, 8 articles met the inclusion criteria. 
      Majority were published in the past 5 years. The scope of the field, 
      socio-demographic and clinical associations, and factors associated with RTW 
      decision-making and experiences were reported. In the thematic analysis, 4 main 
      categories were derived. CONCLUSIONS: Future research needs to be conducted on 
      effective RTW interventions targeting various educational backgrounds, 
      socioeconomic levels, and job types. More institutional and social support would 
      encourage more successful RTW through educational awareness, financial 
      assistance, and workplace accommodations. Future studies should focus on 
      interdisciplinary RTW efforts with multiple stakeholders. IMPLICATION FOR CANCER 
      SURVIVORS: BCS need programs that include social support, individual coping 
      strategies, reliable RTW information, physical rehabilitation, vocational 
      counseling, workplace allowances, and psychological support. More support should 
      be provided through extending the work law and engaging employers. If they desire 
      to resume working, BCS should be fully supported with RTW specific resources.

TI  - A scoping review of exercise referral schemes involving qualified exercise 
      professionals in primary health care.
PG  - 1007-1018
LID - 10.1139/apnm-2020-1070 [doi]
AB  - Qualified exercise professionals (QEPs) have the training, knowledge, and scope 
      of practice to effectively provide physical activity counselling, prescribe 
      exercise, and deliver exercise programming to patients with or without chronic 
      diseases. Healthcare providers identify an interest in referring patients to 
      QEPs; however, the impact of exercise referral schemes (ERS) involving QEPs on 
      patients' physical health is unclear. A scoping review regarding the available 
      evidence of ERS involving healthcare provider referrals to QEPs was performed. A 
      literature search was conducted in 6 databases (initially: n = 6011 articles), 
      yielding n = 23 articles examining QEP delivered physical activity counselling (n 
      = 7), QEP supervised exercise training (n = 4), or some combination (n = 12). 
      Although studies were heterogeneous in methods, procedures, and populations, ERSs 
      increased patients' subjective physical activity levels. Few studies incorporated 
      objective physical activity measures (n = 5/23), and almost half measured aerobic 
      fitness (n = 11/23). ERS involving a QEP that includes activity counselling 
      and/or exercise programming/training report favourable impacts on patients' 
      subjectively measured physical activity and objectively measured aerobic fitness. 
      Based on the existing literature on the topic, this scoping review provides 
      recommendations for designing and evaluating ERS with QEPs that include: 
      objective measures, long-term follow-up, QEP qualifications, and the 
      cost-effectiveness of ERS. Novelty: ERS involving QEPs report increased patients' 
      perceived physical activity level and may improve patients' cardiorespiratory 
      fitness. Promoting the collaboration of QEPs with other healthcare providers can 
      enhance patients' physical fitness and health. This scoping review provides 
      recommendations for the design and evaluation of ERS involving QEPs.
