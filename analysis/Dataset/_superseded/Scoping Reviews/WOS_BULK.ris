AB  - Objective: To examine the extent, scope, and methodological quality of rehabilitation scoping reviews.
   Data Sources: A comprehensive list of scoping reviews conducted in the broader health field (inception to July 2014), with a further update of that list (up to February 2017) using similar methods, including searching 9 electronic databases.
   Study Selection: Articles were included if they were scoping reviews within rehabilitation. Established review methods were used including (1) a PubMed filter detecting rehabilitation content and (2) title-and-abstract screening by 2 independent reviewers applied sequentially to articles from the existing list of scoping reviews and to the updated search results. Full-text articles were reviewed by 1 reviewer, with discrepancies resolved by another after pilot screening with > 80% agreement. Remaining discrepancies were resolved by external experts.
   Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers used piloted and standardized data extraction forms.
   Data Synthesis: We screened 1823 records, including 992 full texts, to identify 251 rehabilitation-related scoping reviews. Rehabilitation scoping reviews had an exponential yearly increase since 2008 (r(2)=0.89; P<.01). The literature addressed diverse topics (eg, spread over 43 condition groupings); 43% were published in Canada. Examples of methodological limitations included: 39% of reviews did not cite the use of a methodological framework, 96% did not include the appropriate flow diagram, 8% did not report eligibility criteria, and 57% did not report data extraction details.
   Conclusions: The increasing popularity of scoping reviews in rehabilitation has not been met by high standards in methodological quality. To increase the value of rehabilitation scoping reviews, rehabilitation stakeholders need to use existing methodological standards for the conduct, reporting, and appraisal of scoping reviews.

AB  - Objectives Over the last two decades, the number of scoping reviews in core medical education journals has increased by 4200%. Despite this growth, research on scoping reviews provides limited information about their nature, including how they are conducted or why medical educators undertake this knowledge synthesis type. This gap makes it difficult to know where the field stands and may hamper attempts to improve the conduct, reporting and utility of scoping reviews. Thus, this review characterises the nature of medical education scoping reviews to identify areas for improvement and highlight future research opportunities.
   Method The authors searched PubMed for scoping reviews published between 1/1999 and 4/2020 in 14 medical education journals. The authors extracted and summarised key bibliometric data, the rationales given for conducting a scoping review, the research questions and key reporting elements as described in the PRISMA-ScR. Rationales and research questions were mapped to Arksey and O'Malley's reasons for conducting a scoping review.
   Results One hundred and one scoping reviews were included. On average, 10.1 scoping reviews (SD = 13.1, median = 4) were published annually with the most reviews published in 2019 (n = 42). Authors described multiple reasons for undertaking scoping reviews; the most prevalent being to summarise and disseminate research findings (n = 77). In 11 reviews, the rationales for the scoping review and the research questions aligned. No review addressed all elements of the PRISMA-ScR, with few authors publishing a protocol (n = 2) or including stakeholders (n = 20). Authors identified shortcomings of scoping reviews, including lack of critical appraisal.
   Conclusions Scoping reviews are increasingly conducted in medical education and published by most core journals. Scoping reviews aim to map the depth and breadth of emerging topics; as such, they have the potential to play a critical role in the practice, policy and research of medical education. However, these results suggest improvements are needed for this role to be fully realised.

AB  - Part of the oral health care in the care network encompasses users in emergency cases. This study proposed mapping the determinants of the use of dental care services within the health care network to address dental emergencies within the Brazilian Unified Health System (UHS) and to verify the main gaps in the research in this area. This is a scoping review that took place in 2018 using Andersen's behavioral model as a reference. A total of 16 studies, out of 3786 original articles identified, were included and reviewed. Two reviewers independently conducted the selection process and the decision was consensually made. The mapping of the determinants revealed a greater number of enabling factors and a larger gap in the results. Greater use of the emergency service was registered by people in pain, women, adults, those from an urban area, people with a lower income, and those with less education. In future studies, primary surveys are recommended, which include all ages, and analyze different groups of needs and users that take into account the country's northern region and the different subjects pointed out by this review.

AB  - The pharmacy profession has undergone tremendous changes over the past few decades. Pharmacists' roles have expanded their boundaries to encompass more patient-centered services. However, the degree to which these roles are practised may vary. This scoping review is aimed at describing the extent and range of the professional pharmacy services offered in hospital pharmacies across different countries and the barriers underlying inappropriate or incomplete implementation of these services. Studies published in the English language between 2015 and 2019 were retrieved from the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, EBSCO Discovery Service, and Web of Science. A thematic analysis across the included studies produced two main themes. "Scope of practice" comprised three subthemes: pharmaceutical care practice, clinical pharmacy practice, and public health services and "Multiple levels of influence" comprised five subthemes: individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and public policy-related factors. The hospital pharmacy services across countries ranged from traditional drug-centered pharmacy practice to a more progressive, clinically oriented practice. In some countries, there is an apparent inadequacy in the clinical pharmacy services provided compared to other clinical settings. Understanding the current pharmacy practice culture across different health care systems is an essential step towards improving the profession.

AB  - Office concepts influence employees' work experience and performance, as well as the profitability of organisations. This study used a scoping review approach to map the field of empirical research on office concepts, identify research gaps, provide recommendations for future research, and inform practice. Systematic searches across three databases identified a total of 257 empirical studies on office concepts. Study selection and data charting were performed independently by two reviewers using standardized forms, with disagreements resolved through discussion. General and methodological characteristics of the included studies were mapped. For studies comparing different office concepts, the degree of focus on spatial design and change processes were also mapped. The findings establish that this is a strongly interdisciplinary field, with increasing publication numbers in recent years. The included studies are heterogeneous, using a variety of study designs and outcome variables, and focus on various aspects of the office environment. Studies comparing different office concepts tend to not focus on spatial design or change processes. This lack might cause these areas to come across as less important than they are, and has implications for practical decision-making regarding workplace design. We recommend that future research efforts focus on conducting randomized controlled trials in real-world office settings. Further research gaps can be identified using the tables and figures included.

AB  - We present in this paper a scoping review conducted in the interactive clustering area. Interactive clustering has been applied to leverage the strengths of both unsupervised and supervised learning. In interactive clustering, supervised learning is represented by inserting the knowledge of human experts in an originally unsupervised data analysis process. This scoping review aimed to organize the knowledge on (i) the applicability of interactive clustering methods, (ii) clustering algorithms being used to support interactive clustering, (iii) how to model the expert supervision and (iv) the effects brought by the expert supervision in the results produced. A systematic search for related literature was conducted in the Scopus database, resulting in the selection of 50 primary studies published by 2018. The analysis of these studies allowed us to identify trends such as: the application in text/image; use of partitioning and hierarchical algorithms; application of strategies based on split/merge, pairwise constraints, similarity metrics learning and data reassignment; and concern with visualization. In addition, some relevant issues not yet adequately addressed were identified, such as: the evaluation of expert supervision; the evaluation of the expert's effort; and the conduction of studies effectively involving human experts, instead of computer simulations.

AB  - Background: Web-based sources are increasingly employed in the analysis, detection, and forecasting of diseases and epidemics, and in predicting human behavior toward several health topics. This use of the internet has come to be known as infodemiology, a concept introduced by Gunther Eysenbach. Infodemiology and infoveillance studies use web-based data and have become an integral part of health informatics research over the past decade.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide a scoping review of the state-of-the-art in infodemiology along with the background and history of the concept, to identify sources and health categories and topics, to elaborate on the validity of the employed methods, and to discuss the gaps identified in current research.
   Methods: The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed to extract the publications that fall under the umbrella of infodemiology and infoveillance from the JMIR, PubMed, and Scopus databases. A total of 338 documents were extracted for assessment.
   Results: Of the 338 studies, the vast majority (n=282, 83.4%) were published with JMIR Publications. The Journal of Medical Internet Research features almost half of the publications (n=168, 49.7%), and JMIR Public Health and Surveillance has more than one-fifth of the examined studies (n=74, 21.9%). The interest in the subject has been increasing every year, with 2018 featuring more than one-fourth of the total publications (n=89, 26.3%), and the publications in 2017 and 2018 combined accounted for more than half (n=171, 50.6%) of the total number of publications in the last decade. The most popular source was Twitter with 45.0% (n=152), followed by Google with 24.6% (n=83), websites and platforms with 13.9% (n=47), blogs and forums with 10.1% (n=34), Facebook with 8.9% (n=30), and other search engines with 5.6% (n=19). As for the subjects examined, conditions and diseases with 17.2% (n=58) and epidemics and outbreaks with 15.7% (n=53) were the most popular categories identified in this review, followed by health care (n=39, 11.5%), drugs (n=40, 10.4%), and smoking and alcohol (n=29, 8.6%).
   Conclusions: The field of infodemiology is becoming increasingly popular, employing innovative methods and approaches for health assessment. The use of web-based sources, which provide us with information that would not be accessible otherwise and tackles the issues arising from the time-consuming traditional methods, shows that infodemiology plays an important role in health informatics research.

AB  - Objective: to map available evidence on parental burnout theme.
   Method: scoping review as according to the Joanna Briggs Institute. Search in January 2021, in six databases of publications in English, Portuguese or Spanish, without time limits. Data extracted and descriptively analyzed by three independent researchers.
   Results: 374 articles were identified and 20 were included in the final sample, all published in English, from 2017 onwards. Parental burnout is a complex, multifactorial problem, distinct from burnout cases, depressive symptoms and other mental health alterations. It affects 0.2 to 20% of parents, has validated and suitable instruments for measurement; if not treated, can have consequences on marital life, work relationships, child neglect and violence.
   Conclusions: this is a recent theme that needs to be explored, due to the possible impact on children's and families' health and on parents' work processes. Protocol registered in the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/jd7vk).

AB  - Objective: This paper investigates the meaning assigned to data citation in order to follow the evolution of studies related to data citation, it tries to answer: 1) What are the motivations of researchers to cite scientific data?; 2) What are the data citation practices presented by the areas covered by this study?; 3) What are the metric analysis for data citation?
   Methods: It is a qualitative and descriptive research, being a scoping review of literature, by searching the Emerald, LISA, LIST, Scopus and Web of Science databases.
   Results: The studies investigated the correlation of citations increment to traditional publications by citing the data that supported them, many studies confirmed the correlation, others did not, and a common cause hypothesis arose: research quality associated with more resources. As for practices, the community is aware that current citations to data are not standardized, and there is a tendency to adopt a citation standard that meets the demands of different types of data. This lack of standard hinders the metric analysis of citation to scientific data that still needs to be explored in research, given that there is a repetition in using the same techniques of traditional citation for this new source of information.
   Conclusions: Promoting the progress of science is the main advantage in making data available, but there are credit and technical difficulties that need to be tackled together by researchers, institutions, funding agencies, data repositories, and publishing editorial teams.

AB  - Coaches' experiences of burnout and stress have been popular topics for research within sport psychology, particularly over the last decade. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide an up-to-date and critical review of the coaching burnout literature, consolidate research findings, assess current methodological and conceptual trends, and identify avenues for research in this area. Five electronic databases were used to conduct the literature search up to September 30th, 2017 (PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, ORIA, Google Scholar). Initially, 65 papers, reviews, and books chapter were identified, but through an iterative process, 45 peer-reviewed, published articles satisfied the inclusion criteria, and the data from these studies was charted. Findings indicated that coach burnout literature is explored from a number of different theoretical perspectives, and shortcomings were identified regarding constructs and concepts used, and research quality. Based on consolidated findings, key challenges are identified, and recommendations for future research are suggested. Recommendations include the use of designs that fully capture the enduring nature of the burnout experience, further consideration being given to the measurement of coach burnout, and further research exploring the clinical treatment and prevention of burnout in coaching contexts.

AB  - Many patients in rehabilitation facilities are affected by polypharmacy. Polypharmacy is associated with rehabilitation outcomes and functional recovery. Consequently, a combination of rehabilitation and pharmacotherapy may improve the outcomes of older people undergoing rehabilitation. A recent report described the concept of rehabilitation pharmacotherapy. The concept envisages helping frail older people and people with disabilities to achieve the highest possible body function, activity level and quality of life. There are two key tenets of rehabilitation pharmacotherapy: "pharmacotherapy in consideration of rehabilitation" and "rehabilitation in consideration of pharmacotherapy." "Pharmacotherapy in consideration of rehabilitation" includes use of drugs to treat impairment, activity limitation and participation restriction based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. "Rehabilitation in consideration of pharmacotherapy" refers to tailoring of rehabilitation considering the content of pharmacotherapy. With respect to drugs and motor dysfunction, anticholinergic drugs are associated with dysphagia and fractures. Increased use of potentially inappropriate medications may adversely affect the nutritional status. With respect to activities of daily living, polypharmacy and use of potentially inappropriate medications negatively affect the improvement in motor function during rehabilitation. Potent anticholinergic drugs are more likely to impede the improvement in cognitive function. In this review, we address the concept of rehabilitation pharmacotherapy and discuss its importance from the perspective of polypharmacy, the effect of drugs on disability and disease, nutritional status and activities of daily living.Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; 20: -.

AB  - This scoping review provides an overview of the literature on tourism routes, concerning 1) the categorization of tourism routes, 2) how the research has been conducted, in terms of methodologies and main research themes, and 3) future research paths. The review includes documents from four databases, written in English, published until May 2020 and focused on tourism routes as organisations of stakeholders under a unified theme to achieve common goals. Based on 194 documents, regional-scale routes under the theme of food and drink are identified as the commonest. The main research theme is route development. Empirical studies, qualitative approaches, primary data usage, and data collection triangulation techniques predominate. Lastly, future research should focus mainly on route planning and management.

AB  - While there have been ongoing calls to reform child welfare so that it better meets children's and families' needs, to date there have been no comprehensive summaries of child welfare reform strategies. For this systematic scoping review, we summarized authors' recommendations for improving child welfare. We conducted a systematic search (2010 to 2021) and included published reviews that addressed authors' recommendations for improving child welfare for children, youth, and families coming into contact with child welfare in high-income countries. A total of 4758 records was identified by the systematic search, 685 full-text articles were screened for eligibility, and 433 reviews were found to be eligible for this scoping review. Reviews were theoretically divided, with some review authors recommending reform efforts at the macro level (e.g., addressing poverty) and others recommending reform efforts at the practice level (e.g., implementing evidence-based parenting programs). Reform efforts across socioecological levels were summarized in this scoping review. An important next step is to formulate what policy solutions are likely to lead to the greatest improvement in safety and well-being for children and families involved in child welfare.

AB  - Housing inequality is far more than a housing matter. To discover how housing inequality has been used across disciplines, and how this may inform future housing research, we performed a systematic scoping review. We found that housing inequality provides multiple understandings as well as a variety of uses, for example, as a measurement tool, a conceptual device, or as subject matter. To draw together useful lessons from this conceptually diverse body of work, we identify four principle uses of 'housing inequality' in the literature - an outcome, an experience, a product, and a construct. These four framings offer a level of conceptual clarity for thinking about, and researching, the different expressions of housing inequality. It contributes to housing research by providing an approach for taking into account the multiple and complex roles of housing, and its distribution and impacts across society.

AB  - Despite an increase in the proportion of women anaesthesiologists over time, women remain under-represented in academic and leadership positions, honour awards, and academic promotion. Current literature has identified several reasons for the observed gender disparity in anaesthesiology leadership and faculty positions, including unsupportive work environments, lack of mentorship, personal choices, childcare responsibilities, and active discrimination against women. A scoping review design was selected to examine the nature and extent of available research. Our review provides an overview of the literature that explores gender issues in anaesthesiology, identifies gaps in the literature, and appraises effective strategies to improve gender equity in anaesthesiology. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE up to July 2019, and included 30 studies for analysis. Most reports used retrospective or survey methodologies. The review shows that women anaesthesiologists face gender biases in the work environment, are under-represented in various positions of leadership or influence, and as authors. Work-life demands may impose a challenge. Motivation and interest in career advancement of women anaesthesiologists have not been well studied. Several strategies have been proposed, ranging from an individual to administrative level, which may help anaesthesiologists achieve equal representation of women in the field.

AB  - Introduction: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) represent a cluster of severe mental illnesses. Diet has been identified as a modifiable risk factor and opportunity for intervention in many physical illnesses and more recently in mental illnesses such as unipolar depression; however, no dietary guidelines exist for patients with SSD. Objective: This review sought to systematically scope the existing literature in order to identify nutritional interventions for the prevention or treatment of mental health symptoms in SSD as well as gaps and opportunities for further research. Methods: This review followed established methodological approaches for scoping reviews including an extensive a priori search strategy and duplicate screening. Because of the large volume of results, an online program (Abstrackr) was used for screening and tagging. Data were extracted based on the dietary constituents and analyzed. Results: Of 55,330 results identified by the search, 822 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Observational evidence shows a connection between the presence of psychotic disorders and poorer quality dietary patterns, higher intake of refined carbohydrates and total fat, and lower intake or levels of fibre, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, vegetables, fruit, and certain vitamins and minerals (vitamin B-12 and B-6, folate, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium). Evidence illustrates a role of food allergy and sensitivity as well as microbiome composition and specific phytonutrients (such as L-theanine, sulforaphane, and resveratrol). Experimental studies have demonstrated benefit using healthy diet patterns and specific vitamins and minerals (vitamin B-12 and B-6, folate, and zinc) and amino acids (serine, lysine, glycine, and tryptophan). Discussion: Overall, these findings were consistent with many other bodies of knowledge about healthy dietary patterns. Many limitations exist related to the design of the individual studies and the ability to extrapolate the results of studies using dietary supplements to dietary interventions (food). Dietary recommendations are presented as well as recommendations for further research including more prospective observational studies and intervention studies that modify diet constituents or entire dietary patterns with statistical power to detect mental health outcomes.

AB  - Sustainable development has become one of the major objectives in building and operating healthcare facilities, as they exert a major impact on the environment and society. It is also critically important for modern healthcare facilities to adapt to an aging population, rapid technology upgrades, and the increasing demand for quality health care. In this background, sustainable healthcare facilities (SHFs) have attracted growing attention from researchers in the past decade. However, there has not been a clear scope of SHFs, which undermines the theoretical foundation of SHFs evaluation. This study identifies, aggregates, and analyzes the existing body of knowledge to address such issue. We attempted to reveal the dimensions of sustainability in the context of healthcare facilities, the links among the dimensions of sustainability, and the framework of SHFs themes based on a systematic scoping review. A four-dimensional model of sustainability was discussed and a framework of SHFs themes is proposed, consisting of core business, supporting service, and organizational environment layers. We suggest future research to focus more on the core business and organizational environment layers and the links among the different attributes of sustainability in the SHFs field.

AB  - Echolalia, a language phenomenon whereby individuals imitate the speech of others, is commonly used by children and adults with autism. Research into the underlying nature and meanings associated with this repetitive behaviour is characterised by a lack of conceptual definitions and conflicting opinions about the functions of echolalia. A scoping review was undertaken to summarise the range of perspectives on these topics and identify associated research gaps. Five databases were searched, and 28 studies met the eligibility criteria. Results showed clear groupings in the topics discussed, based around interactional intent, factors that affect the frequency and type of echolalia, language development, measurement, and functions of echolalia. The review revealed that echolalia has a number of functions for people with autism, however many interventions continue to focus on reduction or elimination of echolalia. Findings suggest that further research is required to examine possible functions of echolalia. Confirming the function of this behaviour for people with autism is likely to have direct consequences for the type of intervention deemed appropriate.

Yet, the extent of research into the use and impact of wearable devices in the underwater environment is comparatively low. In the past 15 years, there has been an increased interest in research into wearables that are used underwater, as the use of such wearables has steadily grown over time. However, there has so far been no clear indication in the literature about the direction in which efforts for the design and construction of underwater wearable devices are developing. Therefore, the analysis presented in this scoping review establishes a good and powerful basis for the further development and orientation of current underwater wearables within the field. Objective: In this scoping review, we targeted wearable devices for underwater use to make a comprehensive map of their capabilities and features and discuss the general direction of the development of underwater wearables and the orientation of research into novel prototypes of these kinds of devices. Methods: In September 2021, we conducted an extensive search for existing literature on 4 databases and for grey literature to identify developed prototypes and early-stage products that were described and tested in water, could be worn and interacted with (eg, displays, buttons, etc), and were fully functional without external equipment. The studies were written in English, came from peer-reviewed academic sources, and were published between 2005 and 2021. We reviewed each title and abstract. The data extraction process was carried out by one author and verified by another author. Results: In total, 36 relevant studies were included. Among these, 4 different categories were identified; 18 studies dealt primarily with safety devices, 9 dealt with underwater communication devices, 7 dealt with head-up displays, and 2 dealt with underwater human-computer interaction approaches. Although the safety devices seemed to have gained the most interest at the time of this study, a clear trend toward underwater communication wearables was identified. Conclusions: This review sought to provide a first insight into the possibilities and challenges of the technologies that have been used in and for wearable devices that are meant for use in the underwater environment. Among these, underwater communication technologies have had the most significant influence on future developments. Moreover, a topic that has not received enough attention but should be further addressed is human-computer interaction. By developing underwater wearables that cover 2 or more of the technology categories that we identified, the extent of the benefits of such devices can be significantly increased in the future.

AB  - Objective: Clinicians should encourage and promote paternal involvement even in prenatal care, as this early engagement has far-reaching, positive implications on a child's life.
   Summary: Men are not superfluous to the abortion process. In fact, a father's roles and responsibilities start before the act leading to conception and continue through the pregnancy, birth, and through their children's lives. This paper seeks to review evidence that these roles play an important part in a child's overall development. Additionally, this paper seeks to suggest direct approaches physicians may take to encourage constructive engagement and responsibility in fathers.

AB  - The aim of this review was to explore the extent and nature of evidence exploring shiftwork and dis-ruptions to cortisol. A systematic search was conducted across five databases: Medline, EMBASE, Psych INFO, Joanna Briggs Institute and PubMed between July-August 2020. Cortisol data were characterised into three main outcomes, 1) cortisol levels, 2) cortisol rhythm, and 3) cortisol awakening response (CAR) during shiftwork. Main findings demonstrate that shiftwork, especially night shift, significantly disrupts production of cortisol, the cortisol rhythm and CAR and, irregular shift schedules produce greater dis-ruptions to cortisol than regular shift schedules. It was difficult to draw conclusions about the impact of shiftwork on movement of the cortisol rhythm and adaptation or recovery of the cortisol rhythm to and from night shift as the literature lacks consistency in definition of methods and variables. The present state of literature demonstrates cortisol levels, cortisol rhythm and the CAR are all disrupted by shift -work, but there is a lack of consistency between studies on use of variables and most of the literature focuses on acute disruption rather than chronic effects. It will be important for future studies to investigate possible mechanisms that link shiftwork, disruptions to cortisol and chronic health condi-tions prevalent in shiftworkers.

AB  - Genetic research is advancing rapidly. One important area for the application of the results from this work is personalized health. These are treatments and preventive interventions tailored to the genetic profile of specific groups or individuals. The inclusion of personalized health in existing health systems is a challenge for policymakers. In this article, we present the results of a thematic scoping review of the literature dealing with governance and policy of personalized health. Our analysis points to four governance challenges that decisionmakers face against the background of personalized health. First, researchers have highlighted the need to further extend and harmonize existing research infrastructures in order to combine different types of genetic data. Second, decisionmakers face the challenge to create trust in personalized health applications, such as genetic tests. Third, scholars have pointed to the importance of the regulation of data production and sharing to avoid discrimination of disadvantaged groups and to facilitate collaboration. Fourth, researchers have discussed the challenge to integrate personalized health into regulatory-, financing-, and service provision structures of existing health systems. Our findings summarize existing research and help to guide further policymaking and research in the field of personalized health governance.

AB  - Entrepreneurial work can be challenging, including financial dependence on both the success of the venture and the continued work ability and well-being of the founder. Popular media suggests that entrepreneurs are at increased risk of depression and suicide; however, the research literature addressing this risk is unclear. Accordingly, this study aimed to explore what is known about depression among entrepreneurs. Scoping review and thematic synthesis of the findings. Thirty-four articles fit the criteria and corresponded to four overarching themes: Social relations, Personal factors, Work characteristics, and Mental health. Each theme contains sub-themes regarding the psychological impact of entrepreneurial work. These include personal factors such as gender, personality traits, and routine. Other factors include significant time demands, putting entrepreneurs at risk for social isolation and relationship strain. These may result in feelings of failure and shame, while stigma and a need to project a positive brand identity may prevent entrepreneurs from seeking the help that they need. This review demonstrates the variety of factors that impact entrepreneurs' mental health. The themes that emerged from this work are congruent with a diathesis-stress model of depression. Together, these factors may contribute to a risk of depression and suicide among entrepreneurs that is, as yet, relatively unexplored in peer-reviewed research literature.

AB  - Background Racism constitutes a barrier towards achieving equitable healthcare as documented in research showing unequal processes of delivering, accessing, and receiving healthcare across countries and healthcare indicators. This review summarizes studies examining how racism is discussed and produced in the process of delivering, accessing and receiving healthcare across various national contexts. Method The PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews were followed and databases were searched for peer reviewed empirical articles in English across national contexts. No starting date limitation was applied for this review. The end date was December 1, 2020. The review scoped 213 articles. The results were summarized, coded and thematically categorized in regards to the aim. Results The review yielded the following categories: healthcare users' experiences of racism in healthcare; healthcare staff's experiences of racism; healthcare staff's racial attitudes and beliefs; effects of racism in healthcare on various treatment choices; healthcare staff's reflections on racism in healthcare and; antiracist training in healthcare. Racialized minorities experience inadequate healthcare and being dismissed in healthcare interactions. Experiences of racism are associated with lack of trust and delay in seeking healthcare. Racialized minority healthcare staff experience racism in their workplace from healthcare users and colleagues and lack of organizational support in managing racism. Research on healthcare staff's racial attitudes and beliefs demonstrate a range of negative stereotypes regarding racialized minority healthcare users who are viewed as difficult. Research on implicit racial bias illustrates that healthcare staff exhibit racial bias in favor of majority group. Healthcare staff's racial bias may influence medical decisions negatively. Studies examining healthcare staff's reflections on racism and antiracist training show that healthcare staff tend to construct healthcare as impartial and that healthcare staff do not readily discuss racism in their workplace. Conclusions The USA dominates the research. It is imperative that research covers other geo-political contexts. Research on racism in healthcare is mainly descriptive, atheoretical, uses racial categories uncritically and tends to ignore racialization processes making it difficult to conceptualize racism. Sociological research on racism could inform research on racism as it theoretically explains racism's structural embeddedness, which could aid in tackling racism to provide good quality care.

AB  - YouTube has evolved to a global platform for formal and informal education. In contrast to traditional sources of learning multimedia, YouTube is a social platform with numerous characteristics that make its real value for education not obvious. We neither know how reliable the learning content on YouTube is, what best-practice strategies for using this platform in education are nor how watching YouTube affects students' performance and behavior. To shed light on these questions, we conducted a scoping review of the literature on YouTube and education. A total of 647 publications were included and analyzed thematically. Four research themes could be identified: (1) Content creation and assessment (2) User attitudes and acceptance (3) Usage strategies and behaviors (4) Impact on student learning. The findings of the respective studies were analyzed and compiled theme by theme. The main results of this review are: (1) There is an increasing concern about content quality on YouTube. (2) Despite versatile production and usage strategies, no relationships were established between such strategies and learning. (3) Most studies on the impact of YouTube on student learning reported positive results in terms of enhanced skills, competencies, interest, motivation, engagement levels, or test performance. We conclude that YouTube is a rich, free, easy-to-use, and enjoyable source of learning content. However, the challenges and risks associated with this platform suggest that it is best suitable for guided learning where teachers make or select the content and include it in a well-defined, pedagogy-driven learning context.

AB  - While altruism has been studied in healthcare professions such as nursing and medicine, the exploration of the characteristics of altruism, as related to paramedicine and emergency care in Australia, is limited. This scoping review explores altruism in paramedicine from the perspective of the paramedic as practitioner, learner, and educator as seen through the lens of the paramedic and the patient. Also discussed is the positive impact of altruism on the patient experience of care. A scoping review was used to assess the availability of data related to altruism in paramedicine. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews was used to guide the process. Search categories were orientated around the subject (altruism) and discipline (paramedicine). A total of 27 articles are included in this scoping review. Initial searching identified 742 articles; after duplicate removal, 396 articles were screened with 346 excluded. Fifty articles were full-text reviewed and 23 excluded. The final 27 were extracted following full-text screening. None of the articles are specific to altruism in paramedicine. The data related to the practice of altruism in paramedicine are extremely limited. The preponderance of data arise from Europe and North America which, due to crewing and service differences, may impact the practice of altruism in different regions. Recent changes to the scope of paramedic practice, workload, education, and case acuity may influence behaviour regarding altruism, compassion, caring, and associated caring behaviours. The practice and education of paramedics including altruism, compassion, caring and caring behaviours in the Australasian setting warrants further research.

AB  - Context: Overtraining syndrome (OTS) is a condition characterized by a long-term performance decrement, which occurs after a persisting imbalance between training-related and nontraining-related load and recovery. Because of the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test, OTS remains a diagnosis of exclusion.
   Objective: To systematically review and map biomarkers and tools reported in the literature as potentially diagnostic for OTS.
   Data Sources: PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus were searched from database inception to February 4, 2021, and results screened for eligibility. Backward and forward citation tracking on eligible records were used to complement results of database searching.
   Study Selection: Studies including athletes with a likely OTS diagnosis, as defined by the European College of Sport Science and the American College of Sports Medicine, and reporting at least 1 biomarker or tool potentially diagnostic for OTS were deemed eligible.
   Study Design: Scoping review following the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR).
   Level of Evidence: Level 4.
   Data Extraction: Athletes' population, criteria used to diagnose OTS, potentially diagnostic biomarkers and tools, as well as miscellaneous study characteristics were extracted.
   Results: The search yielded 5561 results, of which 39 met the eligibility criteria. Three diagnostic scores, namely the EROS-CLINICAL, EROS-SIMPLIFIED, and EROS-COMPLETE scores (EROS = Endocrine and Metabolic Responses on Overtraining Syndrome study), were identified. Additionally, basal hormone, neurotransmitter and other metabolite levels, hormonal responses to stimuli, psychological questionnaires, exercise tests, heart rate variability, electroencephalography, immunological and redox parameters, muscle structure, and body composition were reported as potentially diagnostic for OTS.
   Conclusion: Specific hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolites, as well as psychological, electrocardiographic, electroencephalographic, and immunological patterns were identified as potentially diagnostic for OTS, reflecting its multisystemic nature. As exemplified by the EROS scores, combinations of these variables may be required to diagnose OTS. These scores must now be validated in larger samples and within female athletes.

AB  - This scoping review sought to identify every published study on extraversion in sport. A narrative synthesis was used to interpret findings across research themes. The evidence was graded with validated measures that use quantitative criteria to establish the quality of report writing and confidence in the findings reported. A comprehensive electronic and manual literature search identified 151 published articles (155 independent studies). The research was deductively coded into eight research themes within four causal hypotheses. Study quality varied according to publication date (r = -.52) and the evidence supporting major research questions was graded as 'low' or 'very low' in most instances. The most convincing evidence indicated that athletes are more extraverted than non-athletes (k = 58), team-sport athletes are more extraverted than individual-sport athletes (k = 18), female athletes are more extraverted than male athletes (k = 24), athletes scoring higher on extraversion use more adaptive coping strategies (k = 9), have stronger coach-athlete relationships (k = 6), and tend to be more successful (k = 33). Insufficient evidence was available to draw conclusions regarding playing position, group processes, or team success. Further research on coaches and officials, and using longitudinal and experimental research designs, are recommended.

AB  - Background: Super-utilizers of the health care system compose a small percentage of the population, yet use the most health care resources. Hotspotting addresses this issue by providing high-quality, personalized care to this population. Purpose: This review examined how hotspotting has been defined, implemented, and measured. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guided this review. Twelve databases were searched for hotspotting interventions in practice settings. Results: Sixteen studies were included. Hotspotting was primarily defined by the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers and relied on multiple professions, including nursing. Hotspotting interventions addressed access to care, social determinants of health, patient engagement, and health literacy. Some studies indicated that hotspotting reduced readmissions and emergency department visits and increased use in social services. Conclusions: Patients benefit from an interprofessional, personalized approach to their care planning. Hotspotting can lead to high-quality care through building trusted relationships.

AB  - Since 2015, academic enquiry into the 'Connected Migrant' has proliferated globally. This scholarship has demonstrated the significant role that digital media play in the decision-making, information-seeking and community-building processes pre-, during and post-migration. This review contributes to the expanding field of Digital Migration Studies by summarising the academic literature on the 'Connected Migrant', to thematically explore how digital media is used by displaced migrants globally. Using a scoping review, this paper presents the literature (75 studies) by mapping the key findings using the different 'stages' of migration - displacement, arrival and settlement - to explore the benefits, threats, challenges and opportunities that exist for displaced migrants who use digital media. This paper finds that displaced migrants rely on the use of digital media at all stages of the migrant journey, utilising an abundance of technological affordances that are integral to navigating displacement, arrival, and settlement. However, digital media also pose a threat to displaced migrants who, often already disadvantaged, may have their locations tracked and their data surveilled. This paper concludes with a summary of the scholarly challenges faced by researchers and anticipated future directions in the field.

AB  - Understanding the personality characteristics that help and/or hinder competitive success in sport is of great interest to many sport psychology researchers. Grit (i.e. passion and perseverance towards long-term goals) is one such construct that has recently gained popularity in the sport domain. This scoping review explored the associations between grit and the cognitive, affective, and behavioural variables that reside within athletes and sport settings. Ninety publications were identified through various search strategies. The majority of studies explored relationships between grit and athlete sex, athlete skill/competitive level, sport performance, motivation, mindfulness, self-compassion, and deliberate practice. Constructs that have been previously critiqued as sharing significant variance with grit were also collated from the existing research. Six collegiate-level coaches were consulted as knowledgeable stakeholders and provided input to the results of the scoping review. These results allowed for the identification of future research considerations, including ameliorating current issues regarding grit measurement in sport contexts, and the designing and testing of interventions aimed at increasing athlete grit levels. Additional research with stronger methodological design and rigour is needed, and recommendations to enhance the quality of future studies with athletes are discussed.

AB  - Background and Objective: The concept of precarity holds the potential to understand insecurities and risks experienced by older people in the contemporary social, economic, political and cultural context.This study maps existing conceptualizations of precarity in relation to aging and later life, identifies key themes, and considers the use of precarity in two subfields.
   Research Design and Methods: This article presents the findings of a two-phase scoping study of the international literature on precarity in later life. Phase I involved a review of definitions and understandings of precarity and aging. Phase II explored two emerging subthemes of disability and im/migration as related to aging and late life.
   Results: A total of 121 published studies were reviewed across Phase I and Phase II. Findings reveal that the definition of precarity is connected with insecurity, vulnerability, and labor and that particular social locations, trajectories, or conditions may heighten the risk of precarity in late life.
   Implications and Discussion: The article concludes by outlining the need for conceptual clarity, research on the unique multidimensional features of aging and precarity, the delineation of allied concepts and emerging applications, and the importance of linking research results with processes of theory building and the development of policy directives for change.

AB  - Flow is a gratifying state of deep involvement and absorption that individuals report when facing a challenging activity and they perceive adequate abilities to cope with it (EFRN, 2014). The flow concept was introduced by Csikszentmihalyi in 1975, and interest in flow research is growing. However, to our best knowledge, no scoping review exists that takes a systematic look at studies on flow which were published between the years 2000 and 2016. Overall, 252 studies have been included in this review. Our review (1) provides a framework to cluster flow research, (2) gives a systematic overview about existing studies and their findings, and (3) provides an overview about implications for future research. The provided framework consists of three levels of flow research. In the first "Individual " level are the categories for personality, motivation, physiology, emotion, cognition, and behavior. The second "Contextual " level contains the categories for contextual and interindividual factors and the third "Cultural " level contains cultural factors that relate to flow. Using our framework, we systematically present the findings for each category. While flow research has made progress in understanding flow, in the future, more experimental and longitudinal studies are needed to gain deeper insights into the causal structure of flow and its antecedents and consequences.

AB  - Simple Summary Meningioma is the most common primary intracranial tumour. However, the histopathological diagnosis remains simplistic and to some extent insufficient compared to other brain tumours. Surgery is the primary treatment, and radiation therapy is secondary treatment for tumours that recur. Traditional chemotherapy has so far been ineffective, as these tumours are resistant, and research on meningioma biology is lacking compared to other tumour types. The tumoral microenvironment (TME) plays a key role in understanding various cancers. In meningiomas, however, the TME is poorly understood. It is unknown how the brain immune cells contribute to meningioma behaviour and aggressiveness, and the relationship between meningioma cells and TME involved in treatment resistance also needs to be investigated. It is therefore necessary to explore if the literature holds any evidence regarding meningioma-brain crosstalk in order to identify the gaps of knowledge. The sparse amount of available literature on the subject necessitates a scoping review approach. Background: In recent years, it has become evident that the tumoral microenvironment (TME) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of various cancers. In meningiomas, however, the TME is poorly understood, and it is unknown if glia cells contribute to meningioma growth and behaviour. Objective: This scoping review investigates if the literature describes and substantiates tumour-brain crosstalk in meningiomas and summarises the current evidence regarding the role of the brain parenchyma in the pathogenesis of meningiomas. Methods: We identified studies through the electronic database PubMed. Articles describing glia cells and cytokines/chemokines in meningiomas were selected and reviewed. Results: Monocytes were detected as the most abundant infiltrating immune cells in meningiomas. Only brain-invasive meningiomas elicited a monocytic response at the tumour-brain interface. The expression of cytokines/chemokines in meningiomas has been studied to some extent, and some of them form autocrine loops in the tumour cells. Paracrine interactions between tumour cells and glia cells have not been explored. Conclusion: It is unknown to what extent meningiomas elicit an immune response in the brain parenchyma. We speculate that tumour-brain crosstalk might only be relevant in cases of invasive meningiomas that disrupt the pial-glial basement membrane.

AB  - Cultural groups may vary considerably in their understandings of autism spectrum disorder and approaches to supporting autistic individuals. However, approaches to researching, identifying and managing autism are largely dominated by Western perspectives. This review provides an overview of the literature related to autism and Maori, the indigenous people of Aotearoa/New Zealand. A search of the peer-reviewed and grey literature identified 273 potentially relevant publications, and 13 of these met inclusion criteria. The included publications addressed questions related to Maori understandings of autism, Maori prevalence rates and diagnostic and support services for Maori. Findings suggest broad differences in Maori and Western understandings of autism and slightly higher autism prevalence rates for Maori than for non-Maori New Zealanders. The need for diagnostic and support services that are both effective and culturally appropriate for Maori was also highlighted. These findings are discussed in relation to implications for future research and the provision of services for autistic Maori.
   Lay abstract
   Most current approaches to identifying, researching and managing autism are based on Western views and understandings. However, different cultural groups may understand and approach autism differently. We searched a wide range of websites, academic journals and other sources for published information related to autism and Maori, the indigenous people of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Our search identified 13 publications that addressed questions related to Maori understandings of autism, Maori prevalence rates and diagnostic and support services for Maori. Overall, we found broad differences in Maori and Western understandings of autism and slightly higher autism prevalence rates for Maori than for non-Maori New Zealanders. Findings also highlighted a need for diagnostic and support services that are both effective and culturally appropriate for Maori. We discuss what these findings might mean for future research and the provision of services for Maori with autism.

KW  - TRENDS
AB  - Background The migration of Caribbean nurses, particularly to developed countries such as Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, remains a matter of concern for most countries of the region. With nursing vacancy rates averaging 40%, individual countries and the region collectively are challenged to address this issue through the development and implementation of sustainable, feasible strategies. The aim of this scoping review is to examine the amount, type, sources, distribution, and focus of the conceptual and empirical literature on the migration of Caribbean nurses, and to identify gaps in the literature. Methods Identified records were selected and reviewed using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping framework. A comprehensive search was conducted of eight electronic databases and the Google search engine. Findings were summarized numerically and thematically, with themes emerging through an iterative, inductive process. Results Much of the literature included in our study (N = 6, 33%) originated in the United States. Publications steadily increased between 2003 and 2016, and half of them (N = 9) were journal articles. Many (N = 6, 33%) of the records used quantitative methods. The themes identified were as follows: (1) migration patterns and trends; (2) post-migration experiences; (3) past and present, policies, programs, and practices; and (4) consequences of migration to donor countries. More than half (N = 11, 56%) of the literature addressed nurse migration policies, programs, or practices, either solely or in part. Several gaps were identified including the need for evaluation of the effectiveness of current nurse migration management strategies and to study policies, trends, and impacts in understudied Caribbean countries. Conclusion This review demonstrates the need for future research in key areas such as the impact of nurse migration on health systems and population health. The literature tends to focus on Caribbean countries with higher levels of nurse migration. However, data regarding this phenomenon in other Caribbean countries is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the plight of the Caribbean region and would answer the call from the International Organization for Migration to study policies, trends, and impacts in understudied Caribbean countries.

AB  - The Archaea domain was recognized as a separate phylogenetic lineage in the tree of life nearly 3 decades ago. It is now known as part of the human microbiome; however, given that its roles in oral sites are still poorly understood, this review aimed to establish the current level of evidence regarding archaea in the oral cavity to guide future research, providing insights on the present knowledge about the human oral archaeome. A scoping review was conducted with the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. Five electronic databases were searched, as well as gray literature. Two independent reviewers performed the selection and characterization of the studies. Clinical studies were included when the target population consisted of humans of any age who were donors of samples from the oral cavity. A qualitative analysis was performed, based on the type of oral site and by considering the methods employed for archaeal identification and taxonomy, including the DNA extraction protocols, primers, and probes used. Fifty articles were included in the final scoping review, published from 1987 to 2019. Most studies sampled periodontal sites. Methanogens were the most abundant archaea in those sites, and their presence could be associated with other periodontal pathogens. No consistent relationship with different disease conditions was observed in studies that evaluated the microbiota surviving in endodontic sites. Few articles analyzed the presence of archaea in dental caries, saliva, or tongue microbiota, as well as in archaeologic samples, also showing a relationship with healthy microbiota. Archaea have been detected in different oral niches of individuals from diverse geographic locations and clinical conditions, suggesting potential roles in oral diseases. Methodological limitations may hamper our current knowledge about archaeal diversity and prevalence in oral samples, and future research with diversified methodological approaches may lead to a better comprehension of the human oral archaeome.

AB  - Background
   Involving community members in identifying and reporting health events for public health surveillance purposes, an approach commonly described as community-based surveillance (CBS), is increasingly gaining interest. We conducted a scoping review to list terms and definitions used to characterize CBS, to identify and summarize available guidance and recommendations, and to map information on past and existing in-country CBS systems.
   Methods
   We searched eight bibliographic databases and screened the worldwide web for any document mentioning an approach in which community members both collected and reported information on health events from their community for public health surveillance. Two independent reviewers performed double blind screening and data collection, any discrepancy was solved through discussion and consensus.
   Findings
   From the 134 included documents, several terms and definitions for CBS were retrieved. Guidance and recommendations for CBS were scattered through seven major guides and sixteen additional documents. Seventy-nine unique CBS systems implemented since 1958 in 42 countries were identified, mostly implemented in low and lower-middle income countries (79%). The systems appeared as fragmented (81% covering a limited geographical area and 70% solely implemented in a rural setting), vertical (67% with a single scope of interest), and of limited duration (median of 6 years for ongoing systems and 2 years for ended systems). Collection of information was mostly performed by recruited community members (80%).
   Interpretation
   While CBS has already been implemented in many countries, standardization is still required on the term and processes to be used. Further research is needed to ensure CBS integrates effectively into the overall public health surveillance system.

AB  - Background The purpose of this scoping review was to ascertain how 'telehealth' is utilised within health care, from pre hospital to admission, discharge and post discharge, with patients who have suffered major trauma. Methods A scoping review of the literature published in English since 1980 was conducted using MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Austhealth, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Cochrane library) and Web of Science MEDLINE and MEBASE to identify relevant studies. Results We included 77 eligible studies with both randomised controlled trial and cohort design methodology. A variety of trauma was included such as traumatic brain injuries (n = 52; 67.5%), spinal cord injury (n = 14; 18.2%) and multi-trauma (n = 9; 11.7%) to both adult (n = 38) and paediatric (n = 32) participants. Telehealth is used in pre-hospital and acute-care settings (n = 11; 14.3%) to facilitate assessment, and in rehabilitation and follow-up (n = 61; 79.2%) to deliver therapy. Effects on health were reported the most (n = 46), with no negative outcomes. The feasibility of telehealth as a delivery mode was established, but coordination and technical issues are barriers to use. Overall, both patients and clinicians were satisfied using this mode of delivery. Conclusion This review demonstrates how telehealth is utilised across a spectrum of patients with traumatic injuries and to facilitate delivery of therapy, specialist consultations and assessments, with many studies reporting improvements to health. There is a paucity of high-quality rigorous research, which makes replication of findings and uptake of the intervention problematic. Future telehealth and trauma research should focus on the quality and reproducibility of telehealth interventions and the economic feasibility of using this platform to deliver trauma care.

AB  - Background Special Olympics enables individuals with an intellectual disability across all continents to take part in sport year-round. Through its mission, Special Olympics provides a setting for athletes that aims to foster performance, participation, and personal development. Coaches play a central role in achieving these outcomes. As such, this scoping review aims to answer the following question: What is known about Special Olympics' coach training and practices? Method Our scoping review was conducted according to Peters et al.'s (2020) guidelines. Keywords pertaining to Special Olympics, Program evaluation, and Coaches were searched in six databases to extract articles published between 1988 and October 1, 2021. Results In all, 16 studies were included in our scoping review. Of these studies, nine included information on coach training and 13 included information on coach practices. No randomized control trials were identified. Conclusions There is currently very little knowledge on Special Olympics coach training and practices. Moreover, there is no existing data to support the effectiveness of Special Olympics coaches formal training on coaches' practices nor on athletes' outcomes. There is an urgent need for research in this field.

AB  - Translanguaging was a relatively little-known concept 20 years ago, but has now become a 'household name' in academic contexts. The body of research on translanguaging is ever-growing and the concept covers a vast field from bilinguals' everyday language use to a theory of language and education. By means of a scoping literature review this study focuses on translanguaging as a pedagogy within bilingual education and synthesises existing empirical research on the topic that was carried out between 1990 and 2020.

AB  - The influence of a 'group' is often posited as a key factor that influences behavior. This is relevant in sports, where the presence of norms develops through interactions with important others. As such, an athlete's perception of what is normative may have a significant role in how that athlete thinks and behaves. The present study undertakes a scoping review of research on norms in sports, specifically to describe the extent, scope and range of research conducted to date. Six online databases were searched to identify research published up to January 2021, from which 124 met inclusion criteria. To be included, articles were published peer-reviewed articles, written in English and evaluated norms within an athlete sample. The results suggest that the use of theoretical frameworks and conceptualizations of norms varied considerably and were used inconsistently. Most studies included in this review used a cross-sectional research design, were conducted within North America, and focused on adult athlete populations. This study identified that the concept of 'norms' has been examined extensively in sport, with an opportunity to explore norms in a wider range of samples and with advanced research methodologies to progress our understanding of norms in sport.

AB  - Previous economic estimates of infection with Toxoplasma gondii and chronic sequelae following infection lack sufficient data to establish the true burden of disease and its chronic sequelae. This scoping review aims to fill this gap by updating existing literature regarding the development of postinfectious sequelae following T. gondii infection. Literature published between January 1, 2000, and November 6, 2018, in PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus was searched for a wide range of postinfectious sequelae and economic estimate terms. This scoping review includes summaries from the 108 articles covering 5 main groupings of outcomes (categories are not exclusive) including vision disorders (n = 58), psychological and mental health disorders (n = 27), neurological disorders (n = 17), fetal death and infection (n = 15), and hearing loss (n = 6), as well as a description of other outcomes reported. While the majority of the included studies assessed the incidence of these outcomes postinfection, very few followed participants long-term. These prospective studies are needed to understand the true burden of postinfectious sequelae over the life course, particularly because congenital infection with Toxoplasma can lead to severe outcomes for newborns. This scoping review can be used as an important resource for other researchers wishing to conduct future systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as well as for policy makers interested in developing guidance for public and health care partners.

AB  - Introduction: The competency-based education model is increasingly common for undergraduate medicine training. However, there is a lack of consensus on the concept of competence that can limit the understanding and analysis of the curricular programs that use it. Objective: To analyze the definitions and applications of the terms competency-based curriculum (CBC) and competency-based assessment (EvBC) in the medical education literature to propose a conceptual framework in undergraduate medicine programs. Method: Scoping review with searches in six databases. Publications about competency assessment or CBC in the medical area, specifically in undergraduate programs, during the last three decades. Results: Of 3618 articles, 89 were preselected for full review. 34 articles were included. The qualitative analysis generated 4 main categories and 14 subordinate categories. Conclusions: Although there is no consensus that defines competence, CBC and EvBC, the decision to implement a CBC in an undergraduate medical program implies recognition of the social and regulatory context and a progressive development that responds to particular needs, which may be related to all levels of learning.

AB  - Importance and Objective: Frailty refers to the decline in physiological reserve capacity caused by the deterioration of multiple physiological systems (brain, endocrine system, immune system, and skeletal muscle), leading to increased vulnerability and decreased stress capacity. Women have a higher prevalence of frailty than men, although the epidemiological factors underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Menopause and menopause-related characteristics may be among the contributing factors. Hence, the purpose of this scoping review was to explore the relationship between menopause and frailty. We attempted to summarize information such as the age that menopause occurs, years since menopause, types of menopause, and hormones and inflammatory markers of frailty among postmenopausal women. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Web of Science, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the China Biomedical Literature Service System, Wanfang Database and the WeiPu (VIP) Database were searched from inception until April 3, 2019. Supplementary searches of the references, cited documents, and similar documents of the included literature were also carried out. Discussion and Conclusions: Of 762 papers identified, 15 articles matching the criteria were included. The prevalence of frailty among postmenopausal women ranged from 5.9% to 57.3%. Existing studies suggest that menopause is associated with frailty. Early menopause, hysterectomy, low-free testosterone levels, and high C-reactive protein levels may increase the likelihood of frailty among postmenopausal women. Few original studies have explored the relationship between estrogen and frailty and the results of these studies are conflicting. Changes in hormone and inflammatory cytokine levels may mediate frailty among postmenopausal women. More in-depth research would be required to better understand the physiological and etiological mechanisms of the occurrence of frailty among postmenopausal women.

AB  - This study is a scoping review that reviews the existing literature on educational strategies in training of cesarean section. A systematic search was carried out in relevant databases, identifying 28 studies for inclusion. Thematic analysis revealed the following training strategies: simulation-based training (team training, in situ training, technical training), simulators (low-fidelity simulators, high-fidelity simulators), clinical training, e-learning or videos, classroom-based learning (lectures, small groups), and assessment (assessment programs/interventions, assessment of learners). Simulation-based training provides a unique milieu for training in a safe and controlled environment. Simulation-based team training is widely accepted and used in obstetrics and improves nontechnical skills, which are important in emergency cesarean section. High-fidelity simulators are advanced and realistic, but because of the expense, low-fidelity simulators may provide a reasonable method for training surgical skills. The literature in training and assessment of surgical skills in relation to cesarean section is sparse, and more studies are warranted.

AB  - Introduction The inverse relation between income and depression is well established. Less is understood about the relation between wealth and depression. We therefore conducted a scoping review to answer the question: What is known from the existing literature about the relation between wealth and depression? Methods We searched for studies and articles in Medline (via PubMed), Embase, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, EconLit, and SocINDEX from inception through July 19, 2020. Ninety-six articles were included in our review. Key article characteristics were year of publication, sample size, country, study design, definition of depression, definition of wealth, and association between wealth and depression. Thirty-two longitudinal articles were included in a detailed charted review. Results Depression was defined in a relatively standard manner across articles. In contrast, definitions and measurements of wealth varied greatly. The majority of studies in the full review (n = 56, 58%) and half of the studies in the longitudinal charted review (n = 16, 50%) reported an inverse relation between wealth and depression. The longitudinal charted review showed that (1) macro-economic events influenced depression, (2) wealth status influenced depression across the lifecourse, (3) wealth protected against depression in the face of stressors such as job loss, (4) subjective or psychosocial factors such as perception of wealth, relative comparison, and social status modified the relation between wealth and depression, and (5) savings interventions were successful in reducing depression and varied by context. Conclusion These findings suggest that wealth should be included in our consideration of the forces that shape mental health.

AB  - Background: Progressive advances in proteomic technology has improved our understanding of the chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) pathogenesis and endotypes. This scoping review aims to present a comprehensive and descriptive analysis of nasal mucosa and mucus proteome of CRS patients.
   Methodology: Studies investigating the proteome of nasal mucosa and mucus from healthy and CRS patients via mass spectrometry were included. Critical appraisal of methodological quality was conducted with extraction of protein lists. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on studies including CRS patients.
   Results: 2962 proteins were identified in the 21 studies included in this review. Eleven studies investigated the nasal mucus proteome and ten studies investigated the nasal mucosa proteome. Studies demonstrated heterogeneity in patients, sampling and mass spectrometry methodology. Samples from CRS patients suggested a trend in enrichment of immune system and programmed cell death pathways. Increased expression of proteins involved in cellular components including the cytoskeleton and adherens junctions was also present in CRS.
   Conclusions: Alterations in the healthy sinonasal proteome may lead to the increased immunological, metabolic and tissue remodeling processes observed in CRS. However, it is difficult to draw significant conclusions from the GSEA due to the heterogeneity present in the limited literature available. These findings allow us to direct further research to better understand CRS pathogenesis and its endotypes.

AB  - For centuries, cannabis has been used with many different purposes, including medicinal use, usually bypassing any formal approval process. However, during the last decade, interest in cannabis in medicine has been increasing, and several countries, including the United States and Canada, have produced their own legislation about marihuana and cannabis-based medicines. Because of this, interest in research has been increasing and evidence about its medi-cal effects is becoming necessary. We conducted a review examining the evidence of cannabis in pain. Cannabis had been shown to be useful in acute and chronic pain, however recently, these results have been controverted. Within the different types of chronic pain, it has a weak evi-dence for neuropathic, rheumatic pain, and headache, modest evidence for multiple sclerosis related pain, and as adjuvant therapy in cancer pain. There is no strong evidence to recommend cannabis in order to decrease opioids in patients with chronic use. Even though cannabis-based medications appear to be mostly safe, mild adverse effects are common; somnolence, sedation, amnesia, euphoric mood, hyperhidrosis, paranoia, and confusion may limit the use of cannabis in clinical practice. Risks have not been systematically analyzed. Special concern arises on how adverse effect might affect vulnerable population such as elderly patients. More research is needed in order to evaluate benefits and risks, as well as the ideal administration route and dosages. As cannabis use increases in several countries, answers to these questions might be coming soon. (c) 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

AB  - Background Hyperacusis is a chronic condition commonly defined as a lowered tolerance or increased sensitivity to everyday environmental sounds. It has been viewed as a paediatric disorder which can cause significant impairment to a child's normal functioning. Although clinical guidance highlights the importance of identifying whether the child has intolerance to loud sounds and managing this appropriately, there are currently no assessment or treatment methods that have been designed and tested for use with children with hyperacusis. A review is therefore indicated to consider the profile of children with hyperacusis as a basis for future research into their assessment and treatment. Method A scoping review methodology was followed with literature searches conducted in Embase, PsychINFO, PubMed CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Research articles were included if they reported on research studies describing children diagnosed with hyperacusis, providing clinical profile information, and/or reporting on an assessment or management method for children with a primary complaint of hyperacusis. Data were charted on Excel and verified by a second researcher. Twenty-one research articles were included. Results Children with hyperacusis are typically described in terms of age at presentation, troublesome sounds, physical sensation, behavioural reactions, coping strategies, comorbid conditions and impact on daily life. Methods of assessing the children include semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, neurological assessment, observation and uncomfortable loudness levels. Management methods include psychological therapy, sound therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy, medication and neuro-rehabilitation. Conclusion The information we catalogued on various elements of clinical profile, assessment and management can serve as a stepping stone in future research developing questionnaires for clinical measurement of the impact of hyperacusis on children, and the measurement of treatment related change in clinic and in trials. Positive outcomes were noted by the authors following all of the above treatments; future research must compare these and specify the parameters for optimal results.
