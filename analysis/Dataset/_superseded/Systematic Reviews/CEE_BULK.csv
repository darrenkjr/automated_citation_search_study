89471,Land use and land cover changes and their impacts on surface-atmosphere interactions in Brazil: A systematic review,"Caballero, C.B.; Ruhoff, A.; Biggs, T.",2022,"Major land use and land cover changes (LULCC) have taken place in Brazil, including large scale conversion of forest to agriculture. LULCC alters surface-atmosphere interactions, changing the timing and magnitude of energy fluxes, impacting the partitioning of available energy, and therefore the climate and water balance. The objective of this work was to provide a detailed analysis of how LULCC has affected surface-atmosphere interactions over the Brazilian territory, particularly focusing on impacts on precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and atmospheric humidity (h). Our systematic review yielded 61 studies, with the Amazon being the most studied biome followed by the Cerrado. P was the most analyzed variable, followed by ET. Few papers analyzed LULCC impacts on h. For the Amazon biome, decreasing dry season P and in annual ET were reported. In the Cerrado biome, decreasing P in the wet and dry seasons and decreasing dry season ET were the most common result. For the Atlantic Forest biome, increasing annual P and increasing wet season ET, likely due to reforestation, were reported. Few studies documented LULCC impacts on surface-atmosphere interactions over the Brazilian biomes Caatinga, Pantanal and Pampa. Therefore, new research is needed to assess impacts of LULCC on these biomes, including assessments of atmospheric moisture recycling, and interactions of LULCC with global climate and climate extremes including droughts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152134' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152134</a>,,"What are the impacts of land use and land cover changes on precipitation, evapotranspiration and atmopheric humidity ?",3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,2,2,Evidence Review
89463,Land-use change from food to energy: meta-analysis unravels effects of bioenergy on biodiversity and cultural ecosystem services,"Donnison, C; Holland, RA; Harris, ZM; Eigenbrod, F; Taylor, G",2021,"Bioenergy has been identified as a key contributor to future energy scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement targets, and is relied upon in scenarios both with and without bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, owing to the multiple ways in which bioenergy can substitute fossil fuels. Understanding the environmental and societal impacts of land-use change (LUC) to bioenergy crops is important in determining where and how they could be deployed, and the resulting trade-offs and co-benefits. We use systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the existing literature on two poorly understood impacts of this LUC that are likely to have an important effect on public acceptability: cultural ecosystem services and biodiversity. We focus on the impact of LUC to non-food bioenergy crops on agricultural landscapes, where large-scale bioenergy planting may be required. Our meta-analysis finds strong benefits for biodiversity overall (up 75% +/- 13%), with particular benefits for bird abundance (+81% +/- 32%), bird species richness (+100% +/- 31%), arthropod abundance (+52% +/- 36%), microbial biomass (+77% +/- 24%), and plant species richness (+25% +/- 22%), when land moves out of either arable crops or grassland to bioenergy production. Conversions from arable land to energy trees led to particularly strong benefits, providing an insight into how future LUC to non-food bioenergy crops could support biodiversity. There were inadequate data to complete a meta-analysis on the effects of non-food bioenergy crops on cultural ecosystem services, and few generalizable conclusions from a systematic review of the literature, however, findings highlight the importance of landscape context and planting strategies in determining impact. Our findings demonstrate improved farm-scale biodiversity on agricultural land with non-food bioenergy crops, but also limited knowledge concerning public response to this LUC, which could prove crucial to the successful expansion of bioenergy to meet the Paris targets.",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac22be' target='_blank'>10.1088/1748-9326/ac22be</a>,,What are the effects of conversion from food to bioenergy crops on biodiversity and cultural ecosystem services?,3,1,3,3,2,1,2,1,1,2,3,1,3,3,2,1,Evidence Review
89446,Response of chlorophyll a to total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in lotic ecosystems: a systematic review,"Bennett, MG; Lee, SS; Schofield, KA; Ridley, CE; Washington, BJ; Gibbs, DA",2021,"Background: Eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems resulting from nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is a major environmental stressor across the globe. In this systematic review, we compiled and synthesized literature on sestonic and benthic chlorophyll a (chl-a) responses to total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the water column in streams and rivers to provide a state-of-the-science summary of nutrient impacts on these endpoints. This review was motivated by the need for comprehensive information on stressor-response relationships for the most common nutrient and biotic response measures used by state-level environmental managers in the United States to assess eutrophication of lotic ecosystems and support environmental decision making.
 Methods: Searches for peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed articles were conducted using bibliographic databases, specialist websites, and search engines. These returns were supplemented with citation mapping and requests for material from experts. Articles were screened for relevance using pre-determined eligibility criteria, and risk of bias was evaluated for each included article based on study type-specific criteria. Narrative summaries and meta-analysis were used to evaluate four primary stressor-response relationships: TN-benthic chl-a, TP-benthic chl-a, TN-sestonic chl-a, and TP-sestonic chl-a. Potential effects of modifying factors and study validity on review conclusions were assessed via sensitivity and sub-group analysis and meta-regression.; Results: Meta-analysis of 105 articles, representing 439 cause-effect pairs, showed that mean effect sizes of both benthic and sestonic chl-a responses to TN and TP were positive. Of the four stressor-response relationships examined, TP-sestonic chl-a had the most positive relationship, followed by TN-benthic chl-a, TN-sestonic chl-a, and TP-benthic chl-a. For individual U.S. states, mean effect sizes for the four stressor-response relationships were mostly positive, with a few exceptions. Chlorophyll measurement method had a moderately significant influence on mean effect size for TP-sestonic chl-a, with chl-a responding more strongly to TP if fluorometry versus spectrophotometry was used. Year of publication had a significant negative effect on mean effect size, as did mean nutrient concentration for both sestonic chl-a nutrient relationships. When the same study measured both TN and TP, chl-a tended to respond similarly to both nutrients. Sensitivity analysis indicated that conclusions are robust to studies with high risk of bias.; Conclusions: This systematic review confirms that nutrients consistently impact primary producer biomass in streams and rivers worldwide. It builds on previous literature syntheses evaluating chl-a responses to nutrient concentrations and confirms that benthic and sestonic chl-a respond positively to nutrients across a range of stream and river conditions, but also points to limits on these relationships (e.g., potential saturation at high nutrient concentrations). Lack of consistent reporting of contextual data limited our ability to examine how moderating factors influenced these stressor-response relationships. Overall, we provide nutrient managers responsible for protecting the quality of lotic ecosystems with a comprehensive evidence base for chl-a responses to TN and TP concentrations in the water column.; FU; FX; NR; PU; PI; PA",ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-021-00238-8' target='_blank'>10.1186/s13750-021-00238-8</a>,,What is the response of chlorophyll-a to total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in lotic ecosystems?,4,4,3,4,3,3,4,4,2,4,4,3,4,3,3,3,Evidence Review
89450,A critical-systematic review of the interactions of biochar with soils and the observable outcomes,"Nkoh, J.N.; Baquy, M.A.-A.; Mia, S.; Shi, R.; Kamran, M.A.; Mehmood, K.; Xu, R.",2021,"Biochar research has experienced a significant increase in the recent two decades. It is growing quickly, with hundreds of reviews, including meta-analyses, that have been published reporting diverse effects of biochar on soil properties and plant performance. However, an in-depth synthesis of biochar–soil interactions at the molecular level is not available. For instance, in many meta-analyses, the effects of biochar on soil properties and functions were summarized without focusing on the specificity of the biochar and soil properties. When applied to soils, biochar interacts with different soil components including minerals, organic matter, gases, liquids, and nutrients, while it also changes soil microbial community structure and their occurrence. These different interactions modify soil physicochemical properties with consequences for dynamic changes in nutrient availability and, thus, plant performance. This review systematically analyzed biochar effects on soil properties and functions: (a) soil physical properties; (b) chemical properties; (c) biological properties; and (d) functions (plant performance, nutrient cycling, etc.). Our synthesis revealed that the surface properties of biochar (specific surface area and charge) and its associated nutrient content determine its role in the soil. At the same time, the extent of changes depends on soil properties, suggesting that both biochar and soil properties need to be considered for harvesting benefits of biochar application. Altogether, we believe our synthesis will provide a guide for researchers and practitioners for future research as well as large-scale field applications. © 2021 by the authors.

89444,Nature-based Solutions in Bangladesh: Evidence of Effectiveness for Addressing Climate Change and Other Sustainable Development Goals,"Smith, A.C.; Tasnim, T.; Irfanullah, H.M.; Turner, B.; Chausson, A.; Seddon, N.",2021,"Many lower-income countries are highly vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters and climate change, due to their geographical location and high levels of poverty. In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.

89445,"A review of carbon farming impacts on nitrogen cycling, retention, and loss","Almaraz, M; Wong, MY; Geoghegan, EK; Houlton, BZ",2021,"Soil carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural working lands via soil amendments and management practices is considered a relatively well-tested and affordable approach for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Carbon farming provides useful benefits for soil health, biomass production, and crop resilience, but the effects of different soil C sequestration approaches on the nitrogen (N) cycle remain controversial. While some C farming practices have been shown to reduce N fertilizer use in some cases, C farming could also impose an unwanted 'N penalty' through which soil C gains can only be maintained with additional N inputs, thereby increasing N losses to the environment. We systematically reviewed meta-analysis studies on the impacts of C farming on N cycling in agroecosystems and estimated the cumulative effect of several C farming practices on N cycling. We found that, on average, combined C farming practices significantly reduced nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching from soils, thus inferring both N cycling and climate change benefits. In addition to more widely studied C farming practices that generate organic C, we also discuss silicate rock additions, which offer a pathway to inorganic C sequestration that does not require additional N inputs, framing important questions for future research.

89442,Effect of fertilizer management on the soil bacterial community in agroecosystems across the globe,"Dang, PF; Li, CF; Lu, C; Zhang, MM; Huang, TT; Wan, CX; Wang, HY; Chen, YL; Qin, XL; Liao, YC; Siddique, KHM",2022,"Different types of fertilizer can significantly change soil fertility. The response of soil bacterial communities to different fertilization regimes has been studied widely, but the inconsistent results urged us to systematically study the effect of multiple environmental factors on bacterial diversity and composition under different fertilization regimes. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of a global dataset from 105 publications to explore the effect of mineral nitrogen, straw, and manure addition on soil bacterial alpha-diversity (Shannon and Chao1 indices) and community composition. Mineral nitrogen and straw addition decreased the Shannon (mineral nitrogen: -4.48%; straw: -11.83%) and Chaol (mineral nitrogen: -0.97%; straw: -11.57%) indices, while manure addition increased the Shannon (0.53%) and Chaol (5.64%) indices. The three types of fertilizer all favored the growth of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes and inhibited the growth of Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae. Manure addition had the greatest increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and the least decrease in abundance of Nitrospirae. Manure addition increased soil organic carbon, total soil nitrogen, and soil microbial biomass carbon more than mineral nitrogen and straw addition. Mineral nitrogen and straw addition decreased soil pH, while manure addition increased soil pH. Soil environmental and climate factors significantly drove changes in bacterial alpha-diversity and community, particularly soil pH. In conclusion, manure addition is the preferred fertilization management for most agricultural ecosystems.

The collective impact of land cover (LC) changes has driven a difference in the hydrological components, substantially impacting the availability of water resources and demand. This review aimed (i) to examine the extent of change quantitatively and its effects; (ii) to analyze the relationship with a mean annual rainfall that would further reveal the causes and potential LC type response to hydrologic variables in the Awash River basin, Ethiopia. The results have revealed that urbanization and agricultural activities in the basin are the most trending types of LC, while the forest, shrubland, grassland, and pasture land have been decreasing significantly in the subbasins. As a result, the change in these subbasins has triggered hydrologic variations (runoff, groundwater flow, base flow, and evapotranspiration), and its impacts on downstream basins have mostly been flood and drought. In addition, farmland, urbanization, and shrubland trends showed a significant positive interaction, while forest and water bodies had a substantial and slight negative relation to mean annual rainfall, respectively. Vegetation, bareland, urbanization, and agriculture/farmland are directly responsible for the hydrologic variation. LC change significantly affected hydrologic regimes and the distribution of spatial rainfall is correlated significantly to LC change pattern. Besides, due to the lack of LC management practices, the impact continues to propagate. Hence, this review helps to portray the potential implications and extent of effects of changes in LC on the hydrological regimes. As a result, the implementation of sound water management strategies and practices in response to changing environments to resurrect water scarcity and mitigate flood and sediment are needed straightaway.",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09599-6' target='_blank'>10.1007/s10661-021-09599-6</a>,Land cover change; Hydrological regimes; Awash river basin; BLUE NILE BASIN; CENTRAL HIGHLANDS; NON-STATIONARITY; SURFACE RUNOFF; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STREAM-FLOW; DRY SEASON; DIRE DAWA; IMPACT; CATCHMENT,"What is the impact of land cover change on hydrology and water resources in the Awash River basin, Ethiopia?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,Evidence Review
89428,Grazing Effects on Mongolian Steppe Vegetation-A Systematic Review of Local Literature,"Munkhzul, O; Oyundelger, K; Narantuya, N; Tuvshintogtokh, I; Oyuntsetseg, B; Wesche, K; Jaschke, Y",2021,"The Mongolian steppes with a long history of nomadic pastoralism cover a large area of the Palaearctic steppe biome and are still relatively intact. As livestock number has increased over the last two decades, grazing has been considered as the main reason of pasture degradation. However, the impact of grazing on vegetation dynamics, and its interaction with climate, is still not clear. We reviewed 44 publications in Mongolian language, covering 109 sites in five main steppe types, i.e., desert, dry, meadow, mountain, and high mountain steppe, with a mean annual precipitation and temperature range from 120 to 370 mm and from -6 to +5 degrees C, respectively. We calculated relative changes in vegetation cover, species richness, and aboveground biomass from heavily grazed with respect to lightly/non-grazed conditions. Multiple linear regression models were used to test the impact of environmental factors, i.e., mean annual precipitation, coefficient of variation for precipitation, mean annual temperature and elevation. Grazing had a stronger effect on the vegetation of dry, desert and high mountain steppes, whereas its effect was less pronounced in the meadow and mountain steppes with mesic climate and high productivity. Vegetation cover, species richness and aboveground biomass were reduced by heavy grazing in the dry, desert and high mountain steppes. In the meadow steppes, grazing reduced vegetation cover, but increased richness and had nearly no effect on biomass. In the mountain steppe, richness and cover were not affected, but biomass was reduced by heavy grazing. Additionally, grazing effects on biomass tended to be more pronounced at sites with higher amounts of annual precipitation, and effects on cover changed from negative to positive as elevation increased. In conclusion, grazing effects in Mongolian steppes are overall negative in desert, dry and high mountain steppes, but no or even positive effects are found in meadow and mountain steppes. Especially, heavy grazing showed a detrimental effect on all vegetation variables in desert steppes, indicating the existence of combined pressure of climate and grazing in arid habitats, making them potentially sensitive to overgrazing and climate change. Grassland conservation and management should consider characteristics of different steppe types and give importance to local environmental conditions.</p>",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.703220' target='_blank'>10.3389/fevo.2021.703220</a>,,What is the impact of grazing on vegetation of the Mongolian Steppes?,3,1,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review
89429,Effects of treeshelter on seedling performance: a meta-analysis,"Abe, T",2021,"Treeshelters are used in a variety of environments for forestry and forest restoration purposes. Although their use is often effective, in some cases treeshelters are ineffective. To clarify the effects of treeshelters on seedling performance, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted. Of the 296 studies related to treeshelters, 139 studies were suitable for extraction of data on mortality rate, browsing damage rate, height growth, or diameter growth. The quality of the literature did not affect the results of the meta-analysis. Mortality, browsing damage, and height growth were positively affected by treeshelters in many subgroup analyses, but diameter growth did not conform with the perceived inhibitory effect of treeshelters. Regarding conifer species, treeshelters had no effect on mortality rate and non-ventilated treeshelters promoted diameter growth. However, many subgroup analyses showed publication bias as indicated by the significantly fewer negative-effect studies. Therefore, the effects of treeshelters may be overestimated although the effects revealed by the meta-analysis were reasonable from the viewpoint of plant physiological reactions. Heterogeneity was high in most of the subgroups, suggesting that factors other than the analyzed subgroups may contribute to the variance in treeshelter effects. Studies on treeshelters are concentrated under specific conditions, such as on species of the genus Quercus and a temperate climate. Thus, other under-represented conditions are considered to constitute research gaps. Further studies in these research gap areas are required to perform a meta-analysis with low heterogeneity.",JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13416979.2021.1992700' target='_blank'>10.1080/13416979.2021.1992700</a>,,What are the effects of treeshelter on seedling performance?,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review
89412,"Increasing landscape complexity enhances species richness of farmland arthropods, agri-environment schemes also abundance – A meta-analysis","Marja, R.; Tscharntke, T.; Batáry, P.",2022,"Intensification of agricultural production and simplification of landscape structure have negatively affected arthropod communities, in particular since the end of Second World War. Agri-environment schemes may partly compensate for these losses and enhance arthropod populations, but their effectiveness is higher in simple landscapes rather than complex landscapes, characterized by a large proportion and diversity of semi-natural areas. As the landscape-scale species pool is known to drive local species richness, we tested our hypothesis that landscape complexity determines local arthropod species richness, whereas local management affects only arthropod abundance. Here we undertake a meta-analysis as part of a wider systematic review of the effects of land use heterogeneity on arthropod species richness. We searched for studies quantifying the effects of agri-environment schemes (e.g. wildflower strips/areas, grassy field margins, organic farming) and landscape complexity on arthropod richness and abundance. We additionally separated vegetation- vs. ground-dwelling taxa, because the effects were hypothesized to be greater in the more mobile vegetation-dwelling taxa. As expected, increasing landscape complexity enhanced arthropod richness, but not their abundance. Unexpectedly, agri-environment schemes did not only support the abundance of arthropods, but also their species richness. This pattern was driven by the vegetation-dwelling, not the ground-dwelling taxa, presumably because the higher mobility of vegetation-dwelling taxa allows faster responses to environmental changes. Our results show that agri-environment schemes in Europe benefit both arthropod abundance and species richness, whereas increasing landscape complexity primarily enhances species richness. This is why both local and landscape management need to be taken into account to halt current biodiversity losses in agricultural landscapes. Agri-environment schemes need to be implemented at a larger spatial and temporal scales to enhance landscape complexity, maintaining or restoring biodiversity sustainably. © 2021 The Authors","Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107822' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agee.2021.107822</a>,,What is the impact of landscape complexity and local agro-environmental schemes on arthropod richness and abundance in cropland ?,3,1,3,2,3,1,3,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,Evidence Review

The objective was to estimate (1) the effect of feeding management (zero-grazing, semi-confinement, and pasture), (2) cattle system (specialized dairy vs. dual-purpose), and (3) region (tropical vs. temperate) on milk production (kg/cow/day) and CF (kg CO2eq/kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM)). A systematic literature review was conducted, and for the final analysis, a total of 32 individual CF (from 11 studies) were used. Studies included in the final analysis allowed to calculate CF per kg FPCM, included upstream emissions calculations, and used the IPCC's tier 2 approach for enteric methane emissions. The range of the CF observed in the region was from 1.54 to 3.57 kg CO2eq/kg FPCM. Feeding management had a significant effect on milk production, but not on CF. Zero-grazing compared with pasture systems had a 140% greater milk production (20.1 vs. 8.4 kg milk/cow/day), but numerically greater CF for pasture systems (2.6 vs. 1.7 kg CO2eq/kg FPCM).

The likelihood of concluding that climate change had an impact increased with study duration. However, the temporal thresholds for the effects of climate change to be discernibly varied from 10 to 29 years depending on the species, the biological response and the oceanic study region. Species with narrow thermal ranges and relatively long generation times were more often reported to be affected by climate change. This provides an important framework for future assessments, with guidance on response- and region-specific temporal dimensions that need to be considered when reporting effects of climate change.

89405,Restoration of plant-animal interactions in terrestrial ecosystems,"Genes, L; Dirzo, R",2022,"Ecosystem restoration is one of the most promising strategies for conservation in the Anthropocene. Within ecosystems, plant-animal interactions are critical to their functioning, biodiversity and to restoration success. However, there is no systematic assessment of such interactions across restoration efforts. We reviewed 127 articles that examined habitat restoration and trophic rewilding to synthesize knowledge on restoration of four key plant-animal interactions: seed dispersal, herbivory, pollination, and seed predation. We conducted a metaanalysis using a subset of 56 studies, which compared restored systems with degraded or reference systems. We addressed four questions: (i) To what extent are interactions recovered in restored sites compared to degraded and reference sites? (ii) Which management practices enhance interaction restoration? (iii) Which interactions and animal taxa were most frequently studied? and (iv) Is interaction restoration being studied in areas deemed critical for conservation? Seed dispersal was the most studied interaction, followed by herbivory, pollination, and seed predation. Mammals were the most studied group, followed by birds, insects, and reptiles. Importantly, occurrence of seed dispersal and pollination was more frequent in restored than degraded sites. While several studies were conducted in critical conservation sites, some biodiversity hotspots, particularly in Southeast Asia, have been understudied.

Both sensory pollutants are well known to affect animal behavior and physiology, which can lead to substantial ecological impacts. Most studies on noise or light pollution to date have focused on single stressor impacts, studying both pollutants in isolation despite their high spatial and temporal co-occurrence. However, few studies have addressed their combined impact, known as multisensory pollution, with the specific aim to assess whether the interaction between noise and light pollution leads to predictable, additive effects, or less predictable, synergistic or antagonistic effects. We carried out a systematic review of research investigating multisensory pollution and found 28 studies that simultaneously assessed the impact of anthropogenic noise and ALAN on animal function (e.g., behavior, morphology or life-history), physiology (e.g., stress, oxidative, or immune status), or population demography (e.g., abundance or species richness). Only fifteen of these studies specifically tested for possible interactive effects when both sensory pollutants were combined. Four out of eight experimental studies revealed a significant interaction effect, in contrast to only three out seven observational studies. We discuss the benefits and limitations of experimental vs. observational studies addressing multisensory pollution and call for more specific testing of the diverse ways in which noise and light pollution can interact to affect wildlife.",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.765950' target='_blank'>10.3389/fevo.2021.765950</a>,multisensory pollution; anthropogenic noise; emergent properties; synergism; antagonism; artificial light at night (ALAN); STRESSORS,What is the impact of combined anthropogenic noise and light on biodiversity ?,3,1,2,2,3,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,Evidence Review
89394,The value of biotic pollination and dense forest for fruit set of Arabica coffee: a global assessment.,"Moreaux, C.; Meireles, D. A. L.; Sonne, J.; Badano, E.

H.; Viana, B. F.; Strange, N.; Dalsgaard, B.",2021,"Animal pollinators are globally threatened by anthropogenic land use change and agricultural intensification. The yield of many food crops is therefore negatively impacted because they benefit from biotic pollination. This is especially the case in the tropics. For instance, fruit set of Coffea arabica has been shown to increase by 10-30% in plantations with a high richness of bee species, possibly influenced by the availability of surrounding forest habitat. Here, we performed a global literature review to (1) assess how much animal pollination enhances coffee fruit set, and to (2) examine the importance of the amount of forest cover, distance to nearby forest and forest canopy density for bee species richness and coffee fruit set. Using a systematic literature review, we identified eleven case studies with a total of 182 samples where fruit set of C. arabica was assessed. We subsequently gathered forest data for all study sites from satellite imagery. We modelled the effects of open (all forest with a canopy density of ≥25%), closed (≥50%) and dense (≥75%) forests on pollinator richness and fruit set of coffee. Overall, we found that animal pollination increases coffee fruit set by ~18% on average. In only one of the case studies, regression results indicate a positive effect of dense forest on coffee fruit set, which increased with higher forest cover and shorter distance to the forest. Against expectations, forest cover and distance to open forest were not related to bee species richness and fruit set. In summary, we provide strong empirical support for the notion that animal pollinators increase coffee fruit set. Forest proximity had little overall influence on bee richness and coffee fruit set, except when farms were surrounded by dense tropical forests, potentially because these may provide high-quality habitats for bees pollinating coffee. We, therefore, advocate that more research is done to understand the biodiversity value of dense forest for pollinators, notably assessing the mechanisms underlying the importance of forest for pollinators and their pollination services.","Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107680' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agee.2021.107680</a>,,What is the effect of biotic pollination on Arabica coffee (C. arabica) fruit set?,2,1,3,3,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review

The growing number of operational and planned hydroelectrics requires robust scientific evidence to evaluate impacts of these projects on Amazonian vertebrates. Here, we investigated the existing scientific knowledge base documenting impacts of hydropower developments on vertebrates across Brazilian Amazonia. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature from 1945 to 2020 published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese to assess the temporal and spatial patterns in publications and the types of study design adopted as well as scientific evidence presented. Results: A total of 25 published articles documented impacts on fish (n = 20), mammals (n = 3), and reptiles (n = 2). Most study designs (88%) lacked appropriate controls, and only three studies adopted more robust Before-After-Control-Impact designs. The published evidence did not generally support causal inference with only two studies (8%) including appropriate controls and/or confounding variables. Conclusion: Decades of published assessments (60% of which were funded by hydropower developers or their subsidiaries) do not appear to have established robust evidence of impacts of hydropower dams on Amazonian vertebrates. This lack of robust evidence could limit the development of effective minimization and mitigation actions for the conservation of diverse vertebrate groups impacted by hydropower dams across Brazilian Amazonia.

Many case studies and literature reviews have been published on the subject. However, an updated and global-level synthesis on the effect of SNS on biodiversity conservation is still lacking. Here, we provide the first systematic review on SNS and biodiversity conservation, aiming to evaluate the effect of SNS across different: (i) continents; (ii) taxa; (iii) metrics. We checked 2750 papers and by applying inclusion criteria we selected 27 relevant papers. From these, we extracted descriptive data and 131 comparisons between SNS and Reference Sites. We applied vote-counting, multinomial and binomial post-hoc tests to the 131 comparisons. We found strong evidence that SNS have a positive effect on biodiversity, but also strong geographical and taxonomical biases, with most research focusing on Asia and Africa and on plants. We found that SNS have mainly positive effects on taxonomical diversity, vegetation structure and cultural uses of biodiversity. Our results strongly support the view that SNS have positive effects on biodiversity across continents and geographical settings, as found in a number of local studies and earlier overviews. These effects should be given official recognition in appropriate conservation frameworks, together with the specific forms of governance and management that characterize SNS. At the same time, further efforts are also required to fill the geographical and taxonomical gaps here highlighted, and to advancing our knowledge of SNS through more systematic research.

Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are a simple and efficient ecological treatment technology and have been widely studied and applied as a sustainable solution for different source waters. Based on the analysis of abundant literature in the last ten years, this paper systematically reviews the history and the latest development of FTWs. Meanwhile, the treatment performance and pollutant removal mechanisms of FTWs on the natural water, stormwater, domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater, and agricultural runoff are analyzed. In particular, very interesting information is provided, such as water depth, water surface coverage, the ratio of dissolved to total phosphorous (DRP/TP), the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorous (N/P), BOD/COD ratio, and its effects on the efficiency and removal mechanisms of FTWs. This information will provide useful references and guidance for optimizing the design of FTW and pollutant treatment efficiency of different source waters. This paper also provides an objective review of the limitations of FTWs. Subsequently, the enhancements of FTW technology which are recognized to be effective, including aeration, adding functional fillers or obligate degrading bacteria, and construction of hybrid FTWs, are summarized and recommendations are made for further research.

89364,A meta-analysis of film mulching cultivation effects on soil organic carbon and soil greenhouse gas fluxes.,Yu YongXiang; Zhang YanXia; Xiao Mao; Zhao ChengYi; Yao HuaiYing,2021,"The use of plastic film in agriculture strongly affects the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the release of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) by influencing soil biogeochemical processes. However, no systematic conclusions have been reached regarding the effect of plastic film mulching on SOC stocks and greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets. In this study, a meta-analysis compiling data from 150 studies was used to assess the effects of film mulching on SOC and soil GHG fluxes across different agricultural systems. In addition, the net global warming potentials (GWPs) of SOC, CH4 and N2O were calculated with the GWP approach. Plastic film mulching significantly promoted crop yield by 48.6%; did not affect SOC; reduced CH4 emissions from paddy fields by 64.2% and CH4 uptake in uplands by 16.1%; and increased soil N2O emissions by 23.9%. The effect of mulching on SOC and GHG fluxes varied among agricultural systems. Compared with the non-mulched field, the use of plastic film significantly increased SOC and decreased CH4 uptake in rainfed uplands but reduced SOC in irrigated uplands. In paddy fields, this practice significantly reduced the SOC stock and CH4 emissions but increased N2O emissions. Our results suggest that a low coverage ratio (&lt;50%), black film mulching and flat mulching effectively increase SOC levels compared to those in non-mulched fields, and a low coverage ratio, biodegradable film and ridge mulching could mitigate the positive effect of this practice on N2O emissions. Overall, our results suggest that plastic film mulching promotes crop productivity and slightly affects the net GWP in uplands. In paddy fields, this technology appears to be a 'win-win' strategy for crop production and GHG mitigation, but additional practices (e.g., biochar application) should be adopted to maintain SOC levels for sustainable development in these fields because it greatly reduces SOC stocks.",Catena,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105483' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.catena.2021.105483</a>,,What are the effects of film mulching cultivation on soil organic carbon and soil greenhouse gas fluxes?,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review
89366,"Effects of ph, total solids, temperature and storage duration on gas emissions from slurry storage: A systematic review","Qu, Q.; Zhang, K.",2021,"Gaseous emissions are the main loss pathways of nutrients during dairy slurry storage. In this study, we compiled published data on cumulative ammonia (NH3 ), nitrous oxide (N2 O) and methane (CH4 ) emissions from dairy slurry storage and evaluated the integrated effects of slurry pH, total solids (TS), ambient temperature (T) and length of storage (LOS) on emissions using linear mixed effects models. Results showed that the average nitrogen (N) loss by NH3 volatilization from slurry storage was 12.5% of total nitrogen (TN), while the loss by N2 O emissions only accounted for 0.05–0.39% of slurry TN. The NH3 –N losses were highly related to slurry pH, lowering slurry pH leading to significant decrease of emissions. Temperature also affected NH3 –N losses, with higher losses from slurry storage under warm conditions than cold conditions. No significant relationship was observed between NH3 –N losses and slurry TS contents within a range from 21–169 g kg−1 . The losses of N2 O–N from dairy slurry storage were less affected by slurry pH, TS contents and temperature. The carbon (C) loss as CH4 emissions varied from 0.01–17.2% of total carbon (TC). Emissions of CH4 –C presented a significant positive relationship with temperature, a negative relationship with slurry TS contents and no significant relationship with slurry pH ranging from 6.6–8.6. Length of storage (more than 30 days) had no significant influence on cumulative gas emissions from slurry storage. This study provides new emission factors of NH3, N2 O and CH4 in the percentage of TN or TC from dairy slurry storage.

The presence of pesticides in aqueous media is of a global concern. Photocatalytic processes have gained a lot of attention over the last decades with regard to degradation of pesticides. This study is aimed at reviewing the most relevant reports on the application of the photocatalytic process involved in the degradation of pesticides in aqueous solutions. Moreover, the effects of influential variables such as catalyst amount, pH, concentration of pesticides, light intensity and contact time were discussed in detail. Within this study, three subgroups of pesticides were reviewed, namely insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Meta-analysis was also conducted by the random-effects model. In addition, statistical analyses were accomplished by the R software. After the screening process, 22 articles were found to be suitable in the meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis proved that the photocatalytic processes could remove pesticides with an average acceptable degradation efficiency of 93.36%. The average pooled percent of photocatalytic processes for the degradation of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides was 93.35 (95% CI: 89.89–96.81), 90.73 (95% CI: 80.44–101.02) and 100 (95% CI: 98.12–101.88), respectively.

Use of organic amendments like biochar and compost has been suggested as a novel approach for restoration of degraded soil further improving crop productivity and water productivity. Thus here, we have reviewed the publications on individual and combined application of biochar and compost to find out the potential role of these amendments in agriculture sector. We have concluded that (1) data on well-designed field studies and long-term effect of biochar and compost is limited; (2) traditional methods have been adopted for production of biochar and compost; and (3) biochar and compost have the potential to enhance soil fertility, crop production and water productivity with reduced environmental impacts. Furthermore, combined application of biochar and compost found to be more effective as compared to sole application of these amendments. This review article will play a dynamic role for scientists to conduct research to evaluate these ecological fertilizers best suited for soils, which will be helpful to reduce the chances of soil degradation caused by application of unsuitable amendments. Application of amendments not suitable for a soil may increase the demand of synthetic fertilizers thus making it uneconomical for farmers. Thus, it is suggested for the scientists and policy makers to make a great collaboration to implement this promising technology worldwide.

Although their concentration in waters is measured in micro-and nanograms per liter, even at those levels, they may cause serious health consequences for different organisms, including harmful effects on the functioning of the endocrine system of vertebrates. Traditional methods of wastewater treatment, especially biological methods used in municipal wastewater treatment plants, are not sufficiently effective in removing these compounds, which results in their presence in natural waters. The growing interest in phytoremediation using constructed wetlands as a method of wastewater treatment or polishing indicates a need for the evaluation of this process in the context of micropollutant removal.

For optimal management and long-term productivity, the knowledge on responses of crop yield, water productivity (WP) and irrigation water productivity (IWP) to salty water irrigation under different crop types, soil properties, irrigation management practices and climate environments is needed. Here, a global meta-analysis of 1151 comparisons from 120 publications was adopted to systematically analyze the responses of crop yield, WP and IWP to salty water irrigation. Overall, salty water irrigation significantly decreased crop yield (−17.3%), WP (−12.4%) and IWP (−10.8%) compared to fresh water irrigation. Compared with brackish water irrigation (irrigation water electrical conductivity (ECi) ≤ 3.0 dS m−1), saline water irrigation (ECi: 3.0–15.7 dS m−1) caused larger reductions of crop yield, WP and IWP. Cotton performed best under saline water irrigation (ECi: 3.0–15.7 dS m−1), followed by wheat, maize, tomato and pepper. Brackish water irrigation (ECi ≤ 3.0 dS m−1) did not cause significant differences in the percentage decreases of crop yield and WP among the five crops. Brackish water irrigation performed best in the medium soil, and the percentage changes of crop yield, WP and IWP were −10.1%, −13.2% and 23.5%, respectively. Decreased soil bulk density and increased soil pH significantly increased crop yield regardless of irrigation water salinity. Farmers in semi-humid regions (MAP: 400–800 mm) and applying drip irrigation were more possible to obtain higher crop yield under salty water irrigation. The percentage changes of WP and IWP of salty water irrigation were smaller under drip irrigation than those under furrow irrigation.

However, the effects of these practices differ due to diverse climatic scenario, soil characteristics and management system. To identify the suitable practices that can be effective under tropical and subtropical conditions, a systematic evaluation in the form of a meta-analysis of these practices and their outcomes was performed over those regions. In this work we have included 516 observations from 84 articles published from 2000 to 2021 to analyse the influence of three CSA practices (conservation tillage, cover crop and biochar application) on the SOC (soil organic carbon) stocks over varying periods of experimentation. In addition to this, the combined effect of CSA and other conservation agronomic practices such as agroforestry has also been considered in the analysis. The results showed that biochar application had the most influence upon SOC stocks in the agricultural lands (25.38%) followed by conservation tillage (18.81%) and cover crop (15.8%). Medium term experiments (6–20 years) of these conservation practices showed about 31.00–96.15%improvement in SOC while the effects gradually diminished in long term experiments (>20 years). The combinations of these practices have been observed to have an evidently positive impact upon the SOC stocks in general.

On the community scale, parasitism can change competitive relationships among individuals, facilitate establishment of other species, and eventually increase diversity. Beyond the impacts on plant communities, parasites can directly and/or indirectly impact communities at other trophic levels. In the last two decades, scientists have started to use root-hemiparasitic plants – mainly of the genus Rhinanthus (Orobanchaceae) – as a tool in grassland restoration in Europe. As this may have effects on communities at various trophic levels, there is a need to summarise the existing knowledge on this topic and to identify the gaps in our knowledge. We review the literature dealing with the impacts of root hemiparasites on plant communities, herbivores, predators, pollinators, and soil biota. We particularly focus on the well-studied species of the genus Rhinanthus, as model root hemiparasites, and include species of other genera for comparison. In most cases, Rhinanthus and other hemiparasites had a negative effect on the abundance of grasses, while they rarely affected abundance of legumes and forbs. Hemiparasites had mostly either neutral or positive effects on plant species diversity. Several factors can limit the effects of hemiparasites on plant communities, such as a high level of nutrients in the soil, and a high initial diversity in the host community. For ecological restoration of degraded grasslands, a mixture of seeds of target plant species was usually sown in addition to the seeds of the hemiparasite. This can be particularly important at species-poor sites located in a landscape poor in propagule sources. Hemiparasite introduction should be carried out with caution in habitats prone to invasions by undesirable species. On the other hand, when a grassland habitat is dominated by an invasive species which is also a good host for a hemiparasite, root hemiparasites can be used as a tool against the invasive species, for their potential to increase the biotic resistance of communities. Relatively few studies have investigated the effects of hemiparasites on other trophic levels so far. In several laboratory studies, both positive and negative effects of hemiparasites on herbivores have been observed. In the field, a positive effect of Rhinanthus on the abundance, diversity, or species richness of several groups of herbivorous, predatory and detritivorous arthropods, and snails was observed, but the evidence is quite limited, and the underlying mechanisms poorly understood. Hemiparasites can influence microbial communities, and they can also have positive effects on pollinators, directly through their own flowers and indirectly by increasing the abundance of forbs relative to that of grasses, but more studies are needed to confirm these expectations. Because little is known about the effects of hemiparasites on animal communities, we call for additional research on these aspects. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Perspectives in plant ecology, evolution and systematics",<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ppees.2021.125633' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.ppees.2021.125633</a>,,What are the effects of hemiparasitic Rhinanthus species on plant and animal communities at multiple trophic levels?,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,2,2,Evidence Review

However, reported effects of nitrogen application on tomato yield, WUE and fruit quality vary greatly, mainly due to differences in experimental and environmental factors. Besides, until now, there is no systematic analysis to discuss the effects of nitrogen application on tomato yield, WUE and fruit quality. Therefore, we adopted a global meta-analysis of tomato yield, WUE and fruit quality, including 1096 data pairs from 76 publications from eight countries. We concluded that the optimal nitrogen rate was between 236 and 354 kg ha−1 with the potential of significantly increasing tomato yield by 59.9%, enhancing Vitamin C (VC), sugar/acid ratio (SAR), soluble sugar (SS) and total soluble solids (TSS) by 18.8%, 33.5%, 23.5% and 11.9%, respectively, but decreasing lycopene by 10.8% and increasing nitrate content by 60.4%. Namely, the optimal nitrogen rate could obtain relatively higher tomato yield, VC, SAR, SS and TSS compared with no nitrogen supply. Tomato yield and SS were not significantly different between greenhouse/pot and field at the optimal nitrogen rate. Average annual temperature of 12–23 °C improved most tomato quality indicators (TSS, VC, SS, SAR, nitrate content and lycopene) and yield at the optimal nitrogen rate. There was no significant effect of soil pH on TSS and SS at the optimal nitrogen rate, and tomato yield, VC, SAR and nitrate content were improved more in soils with pH&lt;7, while organic acid (OA) showed the opposite result. Our meta-analysis offered greater understandings of the effects of nitrogen supply on tomato yield, WUE and fruit quality in various experiment sites, average annual temperatures, soil textures, pH and irrigation water depths to produce higher tomato yield and fruit quality as much as possible. © 2021",Scientia Horticulturae,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.110553' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scienta.2021.110553</a>,,"What is the effect of nitrogen supply on tomato yield, water use efficiency and fruit quality?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review

H.",2021,"The rapid expansion of citrus orchards and their increased cultivation intensity have accelerated soil erosion, which has impeded the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. In citrus orchards, the benefits of soil and water conservation measures for alleviating soil erosion have been widely tested at the plot scale. These studies provide crucial information, but they inevitably involve considerable uncertainty and cannot fully characterize the efficacy of soil and water conservation measures. Given the seriousness of soil erosion in citrus orchards and the uncertain factors in the efficiency of soil and water conservation measures, data published in the literature were collected. A meta-analysis of 346 plots (representing 4443 events) for runoff and 307 plots (representing 3596 events) for soil loss was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of soil and water conservation measures in citrus orchards. This study aims to (i) summarize the level of soil erosion in citrus orchards worldwide, (ii) explore the influence of soil and water conservation measures on soil erosion control in citrus orchards and (iii) identify the trade-offs between runoff reduction and soil loss reduction. The results showed that the citrus orchards without soil and water conservation measures had a probability of approximately 80% of exceeding tolerable levels of soil loss. The effectiveness of soil and water conservation measures in reducing soil erosion decreased in the order biological measures + engineering measures &gt; engineering measures &gt; biological measures. The trade-off between runoff reduction and soil loss reduction showed that soil and water conservation measures provide better soil loss control than runoff control.

We systematically reviewed the empirical basis for this general thesis and for the more specific hypotheses that 1) megaherbivores have disproportionately larger effects on Earth system functioning than their smaller counterparts, 2) this is true for all extant megaherbivore species and 3) their effects vary along environmental gradients. We furthermore explored possible biases in our understanding of megaherbivore impacts. We found that there are too few studies to quantitatively evaluate the general thesis or any of the hypotheses for all but the African savanna elephant. Following this finding, we performed a qualitative vote counting analysis. Our synthesis of this analysis suggests that megaherbivores can elicit strong impacts on, for example, vegetation structure and biodiversity, and all the elephant species promote seed dispersal. We were, however, unable to evaluate whether these effects are disproportionate to smaller large herbivores. Although environmental conditions can mediate megaherbivore impact, few studies quantified the effect of rainfall or soil fertility on megaherbivore impacts, precluding prediction of megaherbivore effects on the Earth system, particularly under future climates. Moreover, our review highlights major taxonomic, thematic and geographic biases in our understanding of megaherbivore effects. Most of the studies focused on African savanna elephant impacts on vegetation structure and biodiversity, with other megaherbivores and Earth system functions comparatively neglected. Studies were also biased towards semi-arid and relatively fertile systems, with the arid, high-rainfall and/or nutrient-poor parts of the megaherbivores' distribution ranges largely unrepresented. Our findings highlight that the empirical basis of our understanding of the ecological effects of extant megaherbivores is still limited for all species, except the African savanna elephant, and that our current understanding is biased towards certain environmental and geographic areas.

89338,Effects of large herbivores on fire regimes and wildfire mitigation,"Rouet-Leduc, J.; Pe'er, G.; Moreira, F.; Bonn, A.; Helmer, W.; Shahsavan Zadeh, S.A.A.; Zizka, A.; van der Plas, F.",2021,"Abandonment of agricultural land is widespread in many parts of the world, leading to shrub and tree encroachment. The increase of flammable plant biomass, that is, fuel load, increases the risk and intensity of wildfires. Fuel reduction by herbivores is a promising management strategy to avoid fuel build-up and mitigate wildfires. However, their effectiveness in mitigating wildfire damage may depend on a range of factors, including herbivore type, population density and feeding patterns. Here, we review the evidence on whether management with herbivores can reduce fuel load and mitigate wildfires, and if so, how to identify suitable management that can achieve fire mitigation objectives while providing other ecosystem services. We systematically reviewed studies that investigated links between herbivores, fire hazard, fire frequency and fire damage. We found that, in general, herbivores reduce fuel load most effectively when they are mixed feeders, when grazing and browsing herbivores are combined and when herbivore food preferences match the local vegetation. In some cases, the combination of herbivory with other management strategies, such as mechanical clearing, is necessary to reduce wildfire damage. Synthesis and Applications. We conclude that herbivores have the capacity to mitigate wildfire damage, and we provide guidance for grazing management for wildfire mitigation strategies. As areas undergoing land abandonment are particularly prone to wildfires, the maintenance or promotion of grazing by domestic or wild herbivores is a promising tool to reduce wildfire risk in a cost-effective way, while also providing other ecosystem services. Relevant land-use policies, including fire suppression policies, agricultural and forest(ry) policies could incentivise the use of herbivores for better wildfire prevention. © 2021 The Authors.

89324,"Responses from bees, butterflies, and ground beetles to different fire and site characteristics: A global meta-analysis","Mason, S.C., Jr; Shirey, V.; Ponisio, L.C.; Gelhaus, J.K.",2021,"Climate change in concert with fire suppression is increasing the size, severity and frequency of fires globally. At the same time, insects, an exceptionally biodiverse group that provide essential ecosystem services such as pollination and decomposition, are declining precipitously. We know little, however, about the fire mechanisms that contribute to insect decline. To understand if there is a larger global signature of fire on insect communities, we conducted a global systematic search and meta-analyses on the pyroentomology literature for butterflies (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera), bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea), and ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and report how each taxa's richness and abundance response to overall fire, 16 different fire and site characteristics, as well as fire combined with forest/grassland management treatments. Across 100 studies and 445 effects, we found that bee biodiversity increased after fire and fire in combination with forest/grassland management treatments. In contrast, fire had no significant positive or negative effect on ground beetle and butterfly biodiversity. Furthermore, we did not find any fire and site characteristics that decreased richness across our taxa. Surprisingly, we found that only 7% of the studies quantified fire severity, which likely explains the inconsistent results within the pyroentomology literature. We conclude that further consideration of fire mechanisms will advance our understanding of how insects respond to fires. Our findings on how each taxa's richness and abundance respond to each fire and site characteristic will create a stronger foundation to help scientists and conservation managers make better decisions and predictions to achieve their research and management goals. © 2021",Biological Conservation,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109265' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109265</a>,Bees; Butterflies; Conservation; Fire; Ground beetles; Meta-analysis; Apoidea; Carabidae; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Hymenoptera; Lepidoptera; Papilionoidea; Rhopalocera,"What are the effects of different fire and site characteristics on bees, butterflies, and ground beetles biodiversity metrics (richness and/or abundance)?",3,1,3,3,2,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,2,Evidence Review

Although efforts have been made to assess the effects of acid rain on terrestrial ecosystems, a systematic assessment of growth-related traits across plant aboveground and belowground is lacking. Hence, we performed a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of 755 observations from 69 independent studies to quantify the effects of acid rain on six growth-related traits of plant. We estimated the inhibitory effects of acid rain on plant growth in general and found that aboveground and belowground plant parts responded differently. The acidity of acid rain and acid rain interval had direct modulation effects on plant growth. We also found that there were interactions between acid rain pH and other acid rain characteristics (i.e., acid rain interval, mole ratio of S:N, and acid rain rate) and experimental characteristics (i.e., initial soil pH and plant exposure part), indicating that there were pH-dependent interaction patterns.

89312,Benefits and trade-offs of tillage management in China: A meta-analysis,"Wang, Y.; Ying, H.; Yin, Y.; Wang, H.; Cui, Z.",2021,"In China, deep tillage (DT; to &gt;20 cm soil depth) has increased crop yields by improving soil properties, while no-tillage (NT) has been recommended to reduce the labor and machinery costs. Local farmers are willing to adopted rotary tillage (RT; harrowing to 10–15 cm depth) for easy management. However, the effects of these tillage management methods on agronomic productivity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, and economic return have not been quantified systematically, and their effectiveness remains in question. Here, we present a meta-analysis of the effects of these methods using 665 paired measurements from 144 peer-reviewed studies. The results indicated that DT significantly increased crop yields by 7.5% relative to RT, and even greater increases were observed in regions with low temperatures and with a wheat cropping system. In contrast, NT resulted in a yield reduction of 3.7% relative to RT, however, controlling for the appropriate temperature and long extension duration (&gt;15 yr) could reduce yield losses and even increase the yield. Both DT and NT significantly enhanced SOC sequestration relative to RT. Adoption of DT would lead to both higher total GHG emissions (N2O and CH4 ) and increased energy costs, while NT reduced GHG emissions. DT management exhibited a positive net profit for all cropping systems; NT decreased the net profit for rice and wheat but increased the profit for maize. Our study highlighted the agronomic, environmental, and economic benefits and trade-offs for the different tillage methods and should enable investors and policymakers to ensure the best tillage management decisions are made depending on the location-specific conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

89305,"Impacts of agronomic measures on crop, soil, and environmental indicators: a review and synthesis of meta-analysis.","Young, M. D.; Ros, G. H.; Vries, W. de",2021,"Sustainable agricultural management implies optimization of resources for crop production while minimizing adverse impacts on the environment. This requires a better understanding of the synergies and trade-offs of agronomic management while accounting for the controlling effects of site-specific factors (covariates). We systematically evaluated 113 meta-analytical studies assessing impacts of crop management measures (rotation, cover cropping, residue retention), soil and water measures (irrigation, tillage), soil amendments (enhanced efficiency, biochar), fertilizer use (organic, mineral, combined organic-mineral) and '4R'' fertilizer strategies (right source, rate, timing, placement) on sustainability indicators. These indicators include crop yield, crop N and P (content, uptake, and use efficiency), soil quality indicators (soil organic C, N and P contents, compaction), soil emissions of ammonia (NH3) and greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O), and nutrient losses to water (N and P surplus or leaching). Nutrient management, including 4R practices as well as enhanced efficiency amendments, had the largest impact, increasing crop yields and N uptake while reducing N2O and NH3 emissions as well as N surplus, whereas effects on CO2 emissions were variable. Although all measures positively impacted soil C, the largest effect was due to biochar, followed by organic fertilizer input. Biochar positively impacted crop yield, diminished N2O and NH3 emissions as well as N surplus, and increased CO2 emissions. Within crop management, only cover cropping had a significant positive effect on crop yield, while both cover crops and rotation slightly enhanced N uptake and the sequestration of C and N in soil, thus reducing N2O emissions and N surplus. Minimal tillage practices generally increased SOC, while results for crop yield, N surplus and N2O emissions were variable. Site-specific factors had substantial impacts on the evaluated impacts of measures, most importantly climate, crop type, soil texture, soil pH, soil organic C, N dose, and experimental duration. Considering the variation among meta-analytical protocols followed, we recommend that field studies and meta-analytical work adhere to harmonized guidelines with respect to the reporting of site-level data, experimental design, and the statistical procedures used. This will ensure data comparability between studies, improve the quality of meta-analysis results, and give better insights into currently uncertain or unknown impacts of agronomic measures.","Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment",<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107551' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agee.2021.107551</a>,,What is the effect of crop management measures on sustainability indicators?,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review

However, a growing body of scientific evidence indicates that the commercial cultivation of bivalve shellfish and seaweed can deliver valuable ecosystem goods and services, including provision of new habitats for fish and mobile invertebrate species. We completed a systematic literature review of studies focused on understanding habitat-related interactions associated with bivalve and seaweed aquaculture, and a brief meta-analysis of 65 studies to evaluate fish and mobile macroinvertebrate populations at farms and reference sites. Bivalve and seaweed aquaculture were associated with higher abundance (n = 59, range: 0.05x to 473x, median lnRR = 0.67) and species richness (n = 29, range: 0.68x to 4.3x, median lnRR = 0.13) of wild, mobile macrofauna. Suspended or elevated mussel and oyster culture yielded the largest increases in wild macrofaunal abundance and species richness. We describe the major mechanisms and pathways by which bivalve and seaweed aquaculture may positively influence the structure and function of faunal communities-including provision of structured habitat, provision of food resources and enhanced reproduction and recruitment-and identify the role of the species cultivated and cultivation gear in affecting habitat value. Given the continued deterioration of coastal habitats and increasing investments into their restoration, understanding how industry activities such as aquaculture can be designed to deliver food within ecological limits and have positive influences on ecosystem goods and services is essential in ensuring ecological, social and economic objectives can be achieved.

This article reviewed previous researches on BC and BC-based composite materials, and discussed in terms of the preparation methods, the physicochemical properties, the performance of contaminant removal, and underlying adsorption mechanisms. Then the recent research progress in the removal of inorganic and organic contaminants by BC and BC-based materials was also systematically reviewed. Although BC-based composite materials have shown high performance in inorganic or organic pollutants removal, the potential risks (such as stability and biological toxicity) still need to be noticed and further study. At the end of this review, future prospects for the synthesis and application of BC and BC-based materials were proposed. This review will help the new researchers systematically understand the research progress of BC and BC-based composite materials in environmental remediation.

However, many protected crops require insect pollinators to achieve optimal pollination and there is no consensus about how best to manage pollinators and crop pollination in these environments. We conducted a systematic literature review to synthesise knowledge about the effect of protective covers on pollinator health and pollination services and identified 290 relevant studies. Bees were the dominant taxon used in protected systems (90%), represented by eusocial bees (e.g., bumble bees (Bombus spp.), honey bees (Apis spp.), stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini)) and solitary bees (e.g., Amegilla spp., Megachile spp., and Osmia spp.). Flies represented 9% of taxa and included Calliphoridae, Muscidae, and Syrphidae. The remaining 1% of taxa was represented by Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. Of the studies that assessed pollination services, 96% indicate that pollinators were active on the crop and/or their visits resulted in improved fruit production compared with flowers not visited by insects (i.e., insect visits prevented, or flowers were self- or mechanically pollinated). Only 20% of studies evaluated pollinator health. Some taxa, such as mason or leafcutter bees, and bumble bees can function well in covered environments, but the effect of covers on pollinator health was negative in over 50% of the studies in which health was assessed. Negative effects included decreased reproduction, adult mortality, reduced forager activity, and increased disease prevalence. These effects may have occurred as a result of changes in temperature/humidity, light quality/quantity, pesticide exposure, and/or reduced access to food resources. Strategies reported to successfully enhance pollinator health and efficiency in covered systems include: careful selection of bee hive location to reduce heat stress and improve dispersal through the crop; increased floral diversity; deploying appropriate numbers of pollinators; and manipulation of flower physiology to increase attractiveness to pollinating insects. To improve and safeguard crop yields in pollinator dependent protected cropping systems, practitioners need to ensure that delivery of crop pollination services is compatible with suitable conditions for pollinator health. © 2021 The Authors","Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107556' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agee.2021.107556</a>,,What is the effect of protective covers on pollinator health and pollination service delivery?,3,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,Evidence Review

There is no consensus of CCs under different climatic conditions on soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), soil microbial biomass nitrogen (SMBN), and soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen ratio (SMBC/SMBN) are yet documented. Thus, a global meta-analysis of 40 currently available literature was carried out to elucidate the effect of CCs on SMBC and SMBN, and its ratio for cash and cover cropping systems was conducted. Our findings demonstrated that CCs increased SMBC, SMBN, and SMBC/SMBN ratios by 39, 51, and 20%, respectively, as compared to NCCs. The categorical meta-analyzes showed that the mixture of legume and nonlegume CCs decreased the SMBC, SMBN, and SMBC/SMBN ratios relative to the sole legume or nonlegume CCs. Nonlegume CCs enhanced the SMBC, SMBN, and SMBC/SMBN ratio compared to legume CCs. When CCs residues were incorporated into the soil or surface mulched, the SMBC and SMBN increased compared to the removal of residues. The effect of CCs on the SMBN and SMBC/SMBN ratio was higher in medium-textured soils compared to coarser or fine-textured soils, but coarser-textured soils have a higher SMBC. The effect of CCs on SMBN and SMBC/SMBN ratio was prominent on medium-textured soils having soil organic carbon (SOC) in the range of 10-20 mg g(-1), pH > 6.5, and total nitrogen (TN) in the range of 1-2%. It was concluded that CCs enhanced SMBC, SMBN, and its ratio compared to NCCs. The response, however, varied depending on the soil properties and climatic region. Cover crops can boost the biological soil's health by increasing the microbial population's abundance compared to NCCs.

However, no systematic conclusions have been drawn yet because the environmental factors vary among various studies. A meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate the impact of plastic film mulching (PM) and straw mulching (SM) on grain yields and greenhouse gas emissions from two major cereal crops (maize and wheat) based on data from 61 peer-reviewed publications. The results showed that PM and SM, when averaged across all studies, significantly increased maize yield (13.3 % and 7.3 %, respectively) and wheat yield (12.5 % and 3.5 %, respectively) compared with no-mulching (NM). Generally, PM and SM significantly increased N2O emission by 18.6 % and by 24.7 % compared with NM, respectively. CO2 emission was significantly increased by PM and CH4 uptake was significantly inhibited by PM, while the increase in CO2 emission under SM was not significant but CH4 uptake was significantly promoted. The impact of soil mulching on crop yields and GHG emissions was also affected by temperature, water input amount, cultivation practice and nitrogen (N) application rate. Specifically, ridge-furrow cultivation with plastic film on the ridge was highly recommended for maize production, especially when mean seasonal air temperature was &lt;20℃ and water input was &lt;350 mm. Straw mulching was more suitable for maize production under high temperature (&gt;20℃) and water input (&gt;350 mm). The effect of SM on the increase in wheat yield under low water input (&lt;350 mm) and moderate temperature (&gt;10℃) was not significantly worse than that of PM. N2O and CO2 emissions under SM in the wheat field were not significantly increased compared to NM, while these emissions under PM were significantly increased when water input was &lt;350 mm and temperatue &gt;10℃. However, PM should be given more consideration in wheat production because its greater effect size on wheat yield and lower effect size on N2O emission relative to SM under most classifications, especially under partial mulching. These results have important implications for choosing proper mulching practices to increase crop yields while decreasing the adverse environmental effects in agricultural production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Field Crops Research,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108210' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108210</a>,Crops yields; Greenhouse gas emissions; Meta-analysis; Plastic film mulching; Straw mulching,What is the impact of plastic film and straw mulching on crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions in maize and wheat crops?,3,1,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review

However, global warming, land-use changes and other anthropogenic factors have strongly altered natural fire regimes worldwide. Despite the growing number of studies evaluating the effects of fire on biodiversity, little is understood about how burn affects certain groups that are particularly sensitive to climatic extremes, such as anurans. Here, we conducted a global and systematic literature review of studies assessing anurofauna responses to fire disturbances. We used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models and theoretical information criteria to assess how fire affects anuran assemblages. We analyzed 68 studies, widely distributed in the globe, which examined the fire effects on abundance, richness and/or species behavior. In total, 191 species were considered, being Gastrophryne carolinensis and Lithobates catesbeianus the most evaluated. We reveal a lack of general anurofauna response to fire, as species and assemblages were either negatively or positively affected by burns. We observed that the fire treatments (Prescribed fire, Wildfire and without fire) and the biome where the study was conducted did not explain the variation in species abundance. Most studies were conducted in biomes classified as Temperate Forests, followed by Tropical Savannas and Tropical Forests. We highlight that future studies should consider factors associated to fire (e.g. fire treatment, fire properties), research design and species biology to explain patterns of species persistence and community structure. Although fire plays a key role in shaping several natural ecosystems, we have recently witnessed drastic changes in natural burning regimes all over the world, which imply leading to severe population reductions and even species extinctions. Given this scenario, government authorities should urgently support and invest in scientific studies that evaluate, monitor and test fire management practices in natural ecosystems and therefore establish mitigation actions to preserve the biota constantly threatened by the imbalance of this environmental disturbance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Forest Ecology and Management,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119338' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119338</a>,,"What is the impact of fire disturbance on anuran abundance, richness and/or species behavior?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review
89289,Water quality thresholds for coastal contaminant impacts on corals: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Nalley, E.M.; Tuttle, L.J.; Barkman, A.L.; Conklin, E.E.; Wulstein, D.M.; Richmond, R.H.; Donahue, M.J.",2021,"Reduced water quality degrades coral reefs, resulting in compromised ecosystem function and services to coastal communities. Increasing management capacity on reefs requires prioritization of the development of data-based water-quality thresholds and tipping points. To meet this urgent need of marine resource managers, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that quantified the effects on scleractinian corals of chemical pollutants from land-based and atmospheric sources. We compiled a global dataset addressing the effects of these pollutants on coral growth, mortality, reproduction, physiology, and behavior. The resulting quantitative review of 55 articles includes information about industrial sources, modes of action, experimentally tested concentrations, and previously identified tolerance thresholds of corals to 13 metals, 18 pesticides, 5 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), and a pharmaceutical. For data-rich contaminants, we make more robust threshold estimates by adapting models for Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis that were originally developed for biopharmaceutical application. These models use information from multiple studies to characterize the dose-response relationships (i.e., Emax curves) between a pollutant's concentration and various measures of coral health. Metals used in antifouling paints, especially copper, have received a great deal of attention to-date, thus enabling us to estimate the cumulative impact of copper across coral's early life-history. The effects of other land-based pollutants on corals are comparatively understudied, which precludes more quantitative analysis. We discuss opportunities to improve future research so that it can be better integrated into quantitative assessments of the effects of more pollutant types on sublethal coral stress-responses. We also recommend that managers use this information to establish more conservative water quality thresholds that account for the synergistic effects of multiple pollutants on coral reefs. Ultimately, active remediation of local stressors will improve the resistance, resilience, and recovery of individual reefs and reef ecosystems facing the global threat of climate change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148632' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148632</a>,,What are the effects on scleractinian corals of chemical pollutants from land-based and atmospheric sources?,3,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,Evidence Review
89278,Impact of human disturbance on temporal partitioning within carnivore communities,"Seveque, A; Gentle, LK; Lopez-Bao, JV; Yarnell, RW; Uzal, A",2021,"Interspecific competition is an important evolutionary force, influencing interactions between species and shaping the composition of biological communities. In mammalian carnivores, to reduce the risks of negative encounters between competitors, species can employ a strategy of temporal partitioning, adapting activity patterns to limit synchronous activity. This strategy of non-human competitor avoidance, however, may be influenced by the expansion of human activities, which has driven wild mammals towards nocturnality. We hypothesise that the disruption of temporal niche partitioning by humans and their activities could increase temporal overlap between carnivores, enhancing interspecific competition. We reviewed the published literature systematically and employed generalised linear models to evaluate quantitatively the relative influence of a range of human, meteorological and ecological variables on coefficients of temporal overlap within mammalian terrestrial carnivore communities (orders Carnivora and Didelphimorphia) on a global scale. None of the models investigated showed evidence of an impact of humans on temporal partitioning between carnivores on a global scale. This illustrates that temporal avoidance of humans and competitors does not always follow a consistent pattern and that its strength may be context-dependent and relative to other dimensions of niche partitioning (spatial and trophic). Similarly, the regulation of activity patterns may be strongly site-specific and may be influenced by a combination of biotic and abiotic characteristics. Temporal avoidance of both humans and competitors by carnivores may take the form of short, reactive responses that do not impact activity patterns in the longer term. Although we did not detect a global disruption of temporal partitioning due to human disturbance, carnivore communities may still experience an increase in interspecific competition in other niche dimensions. Further research would benefit from using controlled experimental designs and investigating multiple dimensions of niche partitioning simultaneously. Finally, we recommend complementing the coefficient of temporal overlap with other metrics of fine-scale spatiotemporal interactions.

D.; Armstrong, A.",2021,"Renewable power capacity is increasing globally in response to energy decarbonisation, with solar photovoltaic (PV) projected to be the dominant renewable. A significant proportion of solar PV is deployed as ground-mounted solar parks with potential implications for the hosting ecosystem. Given their relatively rapid introduction, the impacts on land use and the local environment are poorly understood. However, if deployed and managed strategically, solar parks could offer unique opportunities to enhance the local environment and benefit biodiversity, with implications for ecosystem components such as pollinators. With a focus on north-west Europe, we systematically review the available evidence on how land management practices relevant to solar parks can enhance pollinator biodiversity. We assessed 185 articles for the quantity and agreement of evidence for 27 management interventions and assigned a confidence score to each finding. We show that a range of interventions applied to solar parks could increase their ability to enhance pollinator biodiversity. We then use our assessment to synthesise ten evidence-based recommendations on how to improve solar park management for pollinators by providing foraging and reproductive resources, undergoing considered management practices, increasing landscape heterogeneity and connectivity and providing microclimatic variation.

89253,Environmental impacts and resource use of urban agriculture: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Dorr, E; Goldstein, B; Horvath, A; Aubry, C; Gabrielle, B",2021,"Environmental merits are a common motivation for many urban agriculture (UA) projects. One powerful way of quantifying environmental impacts is with life cycle assessment (LCA): a method that estimates the environmental impacts of producing, using, and disposing of a good. LCAs of UA have proliferated in recent years, evaluating a diverse range of UA systems and generating mixed conclusions about their environmental performance. To clarify the varied literature, we performed a systematic review of LCAs of UA to answer the following questions: What is the scope of available LCAs of UA (geographic, crop choice, system type)? What is the environmental performance and resource intensity of diverse forms of UA? How have these LCAs been done, and does the quality and consistency allow the evidence to support decision making? We searched for original, peer-reviewed LCAs of agricultural production at UA systems, and selected and evaluated 47 papers fitting our analysis criteria, covering 88 different farms and 259 production systems. Focusing on yield, water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and cumulative energy demand, using functional units based on mass of crops grown and land occupied, we found a wide range of results. We summarized baseline ranges, identified trends across UA profiles, and highlighted the most impactful parts of different systems. There were examples of all types of systems-across physical set up, crop type, and socio-economic orientation-achieving low and high impacts and yields, and performing better or worse than conventional agriculture. However, issues with the quality and consistency of the LCAs, the use of conventional agriculture data in UA settings, and the high variability in their results prevented us from drawing definitive conclusions about the environmental impacts and resource use of UA. We provided guidelines for improving LCAs of UA, and make a strong case that more research on this topic is necessary to improve our understanding of the environmental impacts and benefits of UA.

89258,Water productivity and seed cotton yield in response to deficit irrigation: A global meta-analysis,"Cheng, M.; Wang, H.; Fan, J.; Zhang, S.; Wang, Y.; Li, Y.; Sun, X.; Yang, L.; Zhang, F.",2021,"The scarcity of water resources has posed serious threats to the sustainable development of agriculture and promoted the need for water-saving technologies. Deficit irrigation has been widely used as a water-saving practice globally. Although it does facilitate the improvement in crop water productivity (WP), its influence on crop yield varies considerably. Therefore, a global meta-analysis was conducted to systematically and quantitatively analyze the responses of both WP and seed cotton yield to deficit irrigation, and explore the optimal conditions for the better application of deficit irrigation in practice. It was found that, although deficit irrigation averagely increased WP by 5.3% compared with full irrigation, it caused a significant decline in seed cotton yield by 20.2% on average. Overall, deficit irrigation performed best at the seedling+blooming stage of cotton under 80–100% full irrigation, in regions with seasonal precipitation ≥ 120 mm and average annual temperature ≥ 10 ℃. Cotton planted in medium textured soils with bulk density ≥ 1.35 g cm−3 obtained highest seed cotton yield and WP. Seed cotton yield and WP were increased by ridge planting with film mulching. Additionally, drip irrigation was most beneficial for seed cotton yield than sprinkler and furrow irrigations. Deficit irrigation throughout the whole growing season of cotton was the most undesirable measure. Seed cotton yield and WP were significantly affected by fertilization rate, and the appropriate nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium application rates were 300–400 kg N ha−1, 79–105 kg P ha−1 and 100–133 kg K ha−1, respectively. In conclusion, higher WP was obtained with acceptable reduction in seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation. However, to optimize deficit irrigation in practice, irrigation method and amount, deficit stage, climate condition, soil property, mulching mode and fertilization rate must be further considered. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Agricultural Water Management,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107027' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107027</a>,,What is the impact of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield and water productivity response?,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review

Few studies have comprehensively explored the physico-chemical and biological removal of nitrogen in riparian zones. By summarizing 123 studies published between 1980 and 2020, we systematically review nitrogen removal from surface runoff, groundwater, plant uptake and microbial degradation in soil, in an attempt to comprehensively outline the nitrogen removal process in riparian zones. The results indicate that nitrogen reduction with buffer widths showed a one-phase exponential decay trend in both surface runoff (R2 = 0.36) and underground water (R2 = 0.16). At a width of 10–15 m, the average nitrogen reduction in surface runoff and underground water reached approximately 79 and 59%, respectively. In the investigation of microbial and plant nitrogen removal, denitrification rates and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions rates increased by 25 and 94%, respectively, in 2010–2020 compared with 2000–2010. The nitrogen uptake, denitrification, and N2O emissions efficiency of forests were notably higher than those of grass. Warm weather is beneficial to denitrification and N2O emissions; however, nitrogen uptake by plants showed a downward trend over the past 20 years. Environmental factors (e.g., climate, vegetation, water quality and hydrology, topography, and soil) showed notable and sensitive impacts on nitrogen retention and the microbial nitrogen cycle. In addition, legacy nitrogen had a long-term effect on waterbodies and may require an extended period to deplete and recover.

89249,A review of the impacts of dams on the hydromorphology of tropical rivers,"Chong, X.Y.; Vericat, D.; Batalla, R.J.; Teo, F.Y.; Lee, K.S.P.; Gibbins, C.N.",2021,"A major programme of dam building is underway in many of the world's tropical countries. This raises the question of whether existing research is sufficient to fully understand the impacts of dams on tropical river systems. This paper provides a systematic review of what is known about the impacts of dams on river flows, sediment dynamics and geomorphic processes in tropical rivers. The review was conducted using the SCOPUS® and Web of Science® databases, with papers analysed to look for temporal and geographic patterns in published work, assess the approaches used to help understand dam impacts, and assess the nature and magnitude of impacts on the flow regimes and geomorphology (‘hydromorphology’) of tropical rivers. As part of the review, a meta-analysis was used to compare key impacts across different climate regions. Although research on tropical rivers remains scarce, existing work is sufficient to allow us to draw some very broad, general conclusions about the nature of hydromorphic change: tropical dams have resulted in reductions in flow variability, lower flood peaks, reductions in sediment supply and loads, and complex geomorphic adjustments that include both channel incision and aggradation at different times and downstream distances. At this general level, impacts are consistent with those observed in other climate regions. However, studies are too few and variable in their focus to determine whether some of the more specific aspects of change observed in tropical rivers (e.g. time to reach a new, adjusted state, and downstream recovery distance) differ consistently from those in other regions. The review helps stress the need for research that incorporates before-after comparisons of flow and geomorphic conditions, and for the wider application of tools available now for assessing hydromorphic change. Very few studies have considered hydromorphic processes when designing flow operational policies for tropical dams. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148686' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148686</a>,,What is the impact of dams on tropical river systems?,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,Evidence Review

W.; Wang Can; Wang RanRan",2021,"The global popularity of green roofs (GRs) rises as urban runoff becomes a primary environmental concern in both developed and developing countries. Although a growing number of studies have measured the runoff retention (RR) performance of GRs and investigated the underpinning factors, a systematic and quantitative understanding is lacking. This study applies a statistical approach on a dataset of 2375 original experimental samples associated with the RR performance of GRs observed across 21 countries, consolidated from 75 internationally peer-reviewed studies published in 2005-2020. The results show that the sampled RR rates (i.e., the proportion of rainfall retained on a per-event basis) range widely (0-100%), with an average of 62%. Rainfall intensity, substrate depth, GR surface coverage, climate type, vegetation type, and season type partially explain the variances in retention performance. Moreover, the effects of some factors (e.g., rainfall intensity) are not isolated but contingent on other factors (e.g., vegetative cover). This global synthesis shows few samples emanate from Africa, Central America, and Central Asia, highlighting the need of more GR research and applications in these regions. The average GR RR rate appears lower than some specified in green building standards, which implies the need to further improve the RR performance of GRs or combine GRs with other RR measures. Contingent effects of GR RR incluencing factors demonstrate the need to leverage design parameters and to account for local weather and climate characteristics in the optimization of GR performance.","Resources, Conservation and Recycling",<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105577' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105577</a>,,What is the effectiveness of different types of green roofs for stormwater runoff retention?,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,3,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review

Despite mandated by several high-level international legislative instruments, comprehensive quantitative evaluation on ecosystem impacts of marine NIS is scarce and lack a robust and data-driven assessment framework. The current study is aiming at fulfilling this gap, through quantitative assessment on the effects of the widespread NIS of the Baltic Sea on multiple ecosystem features and components including direct food-web effects. The outcomes of this study allowed identifying the most impacting widespread NIS, together with defining the processes underlying the most significant changes and outlined major sources of uncertainty. Lack and/or bias in the availability of evidence of impacts was recorded for several (both recent and early) introductions. Realizing a sophisticated, data and information-hungry framework for the evaluation of ecosystem impacts of NIS is not pragmatic for management purposes in the foreseeable future. Instead, simple approaches, such as application of common statistical parameters like absolute effect size, are more likely to result in tangible outcomes. As bearing no unit, effect sizes can be later easily aggregated across taxa, affected ecosystem features or spatial scales.

Here, we synthesized the results from 40 peer-reviewed publications, and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the general responses of 15 variables related to physiological and psychological functions to forest exposure. We summarized the evidence that forest exposure was beneficial to health, such as reducing systolic blood pressure (SMD = −0.27), diastolic blood pressure (SMD = −0.28), heart rate (SMD = −0.27), sympathetic nervous activity (SMD = −0.24), salivary cortisol (SMD = −0.26), and increasing parasympathetic nervous activity (SMD = 0.23). Evidence showed that lower levels of systolic blood pressure and sympathetic nervous activity, and higher levels of parasympathetic nervous activity were associated with duration exposure to the forest, while lower levels of heart rate and higher levels of parasympathetic nervous activity were associated with methods of intervention with forest environment. When exposed to the forest, it was positive in terms of comfortable – uncomfortable (SMD = 2.07), natural – artificial (SMD = 2.56), and soothing – awakening (SMD = 2.01).

J.; Kroll, A. J.; Knoth, J. L.",2021,"We employed a systematic evidence review to evaluate empirical scientific evidence for the effectiveness of buffering headwater (typically non-fish-bearing) streams to maintain stream temperature and stream-associated amphibian populations in the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States. To address our synthesis objective, we identified thirteen temperature, seven amphibian, and two temperature/amphibian primary research studies that met objective inclusion criteria. We evaluated external validity for how study treatments inform or were linked to causal factors influencing temperature response (a) and how the sampled population represented or provided inference to an intended target population or landscape (b). The evidence indicated substantial variability in the temperature response to streamside buffers. The effect size for the mean 7-day maximum temperature metric showed a positive association when comparing no-buffers (clearcut) to treatments with wide buffers (≥ 30 m). However, this effect varied substantially and overlap existed in effect sizes among no-cut buffers, no-cut plus variable retention buffers, and no-cut patch buffers all ≤ 20 m wide. Large variability in effect size among treatments obscured any potential trend between effect size for the seasonal (summer) mean daily maximum temperature metric and buffer width. Shade was correlated with temperature response within several studies, but direct comparisons of treatment effectiveness among studies as a function of shade was confounded by different measurement methods. The evidence also indicated that variation in temperature response among studies may be associated with multiple factors (geology, hydrology, topography, latitude, and stream azimuth) that influence thermal sensitivity of streams to shade loss. For amphibians, we found mixed evidence for relationships between population responses and buffers maintained along streams after forest harvest. Specifically, we did not find evidence to support the contention that positive population responses are associated consistently with larger buffers. Also, considerable uncertainty exists about which environmental covariates reliably explain variation in amphibian population responses.

Reasonable recycling of agricultural waste can affect soil productivity and environmental health, thus playing a crucial role in the sustainability of agricultural production. Through a meta-analysis of 160 studies in the region of upland double cropping in China, we evaluate crop yield and soil quality responses to organic amendments. Results indicated that soil quality index (17.6%–26.3%) and crop yield (6.0%–9.0%) were significantly increased by adding organic amendments to chemical fertilizer. Combination of organic materials with total chemical fertilizer (OTC) and with part chemical fertilizer (ORC) significantly increased the yield by 8.3% and 8.7% and soil quality by19.5% and 18.4%, respectively. However, application of organic materials alone (O) decreased yields (by −0.6%), but significantly increased soil quality (by 49.1%). On average, organic amendments resulted in higher crop yield and soil quality index, despite variability introduced by tillage regimes and conditions of soil and climate. Relatively larger positive effect in crop yield and soil quality occurred with mean annual precipitation >1000 and <600 mm, respectively. Additional analyses found that biochar, organic fertilizer or ORC can promote sustainable agricultural development via improving crop yields, soil quality, and reducing nitrogen losses. Our results provide the first systematic review of effect of the organic amendments on the balance between soil quality and crop yield. The findings suggest that impacts of adding organic amendments to chemical fertilizer may be used as the foundation for policies. However, the combined use of organic amendments and other farmland management practices still present an area that needs further research in order to promote sustainable development of agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Geoderma,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115197' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115197</a>,,What are the effects of organic fertilizer on crop yield and soil quality in double cropping systems in upland habitat of China?,3,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review
89182,Could cattle ranching and soybean cultivation be sustainable? A systematic review and a meta-analysis for the Amazon,"Bueno, R. D.; Marchetti, L.; Cocozza, C.; Marchetti, M.; Salbitano, F.",2021,"Tropical forests are being destroyed to make space for agricultural activities with the assumption that they are required to feed the growing global population. Consequently, more sustainable practices are needed to guarantee food security and environmental protection of highly threatened natural biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon rainforest. Cattle ranching and soybean cultivation are by far the greater drivers of land use change and deforestation in the Amazon region. We performed a systematic review of papers related to these two main drivers and a meta-analysis on the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. The results of the review highlight a large concern about the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops on the ecosystem dynamics and functionality of the Amazon biome, in addition to the clear relationship with deforestation. Another relevant finding is the large gap in empirical research concerning the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. Such a gap is evident since only 13 studies from the initial database met the requirements for a meta-analysis. Of the 171 comparisons between the ecosystem services provided in conventional land-uses and those adopting sustainable practices, the overall model indicated a non-significant effect, although the results were heterogeneous. Crop yield and herbage biomass were negatively affected, while livestock productivity, soil organic carbon, soil fertility and woody biomass were positively affected. Also, the six sustainable practices evaluated showed different outcomes, from a predominance of positive effects in silvopastoral systems, to a predominance of negative effects on agrosilvicultural systems. Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that cattle ranching and soybean cultivation can indeed be conducted in a more sustainable way, enhancing the provision of ecosystem services while avoiding deforestation. In turn, our results also highlight the lack of empirical data and the need to standardize the methodologies used to deeply assess the effects of such practices.

S.; Kim, H.; Huang, C. P.; Hung, C. M.",2021,"Biochar is a carbon-rich material prepared from the pyrolysis of biomass under various conditions. Recently, biochar drew great attention due to its promising potential in climate change mitigation, soil amendment, and environmental control. Obviously, biochar can be a beneficial soil amendment in several ways including preventing nutrients loss due to leaching, increasing N and P mineralization, and enabling the microbial mediation of N2O and CO2 emissions. However, there are also conflicting reports on biochar effects, such as water logging and weathering induced change of surface properties that ultimately affects microbial growth and soil fertility. Despite the voluminous reports on soil and biochar properties, few studies have systematically addressed the effects of biochar on the sequestration of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in soils. Information on microbially-mediated transformation of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) species in the soil environment remains relatively uncertain. A systematic documentation of how biochar influences the fate and transport of carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen in soil is crucial to promoting biochar applications toward environmental sustainability. This report first provides an overview on the adsorption of carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen species on biochar, particularly in soil systems. Then, the biochar-mediated transformation of organic species, and the transport of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in soil systems are discussed. This review also reports on the weathering process of biochar and implications in the soil environment. Lastly, the current knowledge gaps and priority research directions for the biochar-amended systems in the future are assessed.

Africa is exposed to many such water risks. Nature-based solutions for adaptation should be designed to benefit biodiversity and can also provide multiple co-benefits, such as carbon sequestration. A systematic review of over 10 000 publications revealed 150 containing 492 quantitative case studies related to the effectiveness of nature-based solutions for downstream water quantity and water quality (including sediment load) in Africa. The solutions assessed included landscape-scale interventions and patterns (forests and natural wetlands) and site-specific interventions (constructed wetlands and urban interventions e.g. soakaways). Consistent evidence was found that nature-based solutions can improve water quality. In contrast, evidence of their effectiveness for improving downstream water resource quantity was inconsistent, with most case studies showing a decline in water yield where forests (particularly plantations of non-native species) and wetlands are present. The evidence further suggests that restoration of forests and floodplain wetlands can reduce flood risk, and their conservation can prevent future increases in risk; in contrast, this is not the case for headwater wetlands. Potential trade-offs identified include nature-based solutions reducing flood risk and pollution, whilst decreasing downstream water resource quantity. The evidence provides a scientific underpinning for policy and planning for nature-based solutions to water-related risks in Africa, though implementation will require local knowledge.",Environmental Research Letters,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0210' target='_blank'>10.1088/1748-9326/ac0210</a>,,What is the effectiveness of nature-based solutions to address water issues in Africa?,2,1,2,2,3,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,Evidence Review

C.; Norton, D. A.; Brugman, A.; Funaki, M.; Mathieu, C.; Songling, C.; Suryaningrum, F.; Buckley, H. L.",2021,"An ever-expanding human population, climatic changes and the spread of intensive farming practices are putting increasing pressure on agroecosystems and their inherent biodiversity. Non-production vegetation elements, such as woody patches, riparian margins and restoration plantings, are vital for conserving agroecosystem biodiversity. Furthermore, such elements are key building blocks that are manipulated via land management, thereby influencing the biotic and abiotic processes that underpin functioning agroecosystems. Despite this critical role, there has been a lack of synthesis on which types of vegetation elements drive and/or support ecological processes, and the mechanisms by which this occurs. Using a systematic, quantitative literature review of 342 articles, we asked the following questions: what are the effects of non-production vegetation on agroecosystem processes and how are these processes measured within global agroecosystems? Woody patches, hedgerows and borders, riparian margins, and shelterbelts were the most studied types of non-production vegetation. The majority (61%) of studies showed positive effects of non-production vegetation on ecological processes, where the presence, level or rate of the studied process was increased or enhanced. However, four key research gaps were revealed: (a) most studies (83%) used proxies for, instead of direct measurements of, ecosystem processes related to non-production vegetation; (b) study designs used to investigate non-production vegetation effects on ecosystem processes directly were largely limited to observational comparisons of non-production vegetation types, farm-scale vegetation configurations and different proximities to vegetation in terms of the effect on ecological processes; relatively few studies used manipulative experiments; (c) the relatively few studies directly measuring ecosystem processes were dominated by four process categories: invertebrate biocontrol, predator and natural enemy spillover, animal movement, and ecosystem cycling and (d) the methods used to directly measure non-production vegetation effects comprised a surprisingly limited set of approaches. To fill key research gaps that will inform the use of non-production vegetation to enhance agroecosystem processes, we present a framework for future research that emphasizes the need to combine an understanding of human decision-making with carefully designed and targeted investigations into the roles of taxa, ecosystem processes, and landscape heterogeneity related to non-production vegetation, at multiple spatial scales within agroecosystems.

89170,Remediation of mercury-contaminated soils and sediments using biochar: a critical review,"Yang, Q.; Wang, Y. J.; Zhong, H.",2021,"The transformation of mercury (Hg) into the more toxic and bioaccumulative form methylmercury (MeHg) in soils and sediments can lead to the biomagnification of MeHg through the food chain, which poses ecological and health risks. In the last decade, biochar application, an in situ remediation technique, has been shown to be effective in mitigating the risks from Hg in soils and sediments. However, uncertainties associated with biochar use and its underlying mechanisms remain. Here, we summarize recent studies on the effects and advantages of biochar amendment related to Hg biogeochemistry and its bioavailability in soils and sediments and systematically analyze the progress made in understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for reductions in Hg bioaccumulation. The existing literature indicates (1) that biochar application decreases the mobility of inorganic Hg in soils and sediments and (2) that biochar can reduce the bioavailability of MeHg and its accumulation in crops but has a complex effect on net MeHg production. In this review, two main mechanisms, a direct mechanism (e.g., Hg-biochar binding) and an indirect mechanism (e.g., biochar-impacted sulfur cycling and thus Hg-soil binding), that explain the reduction in Hg bioavailability by biochar amendment based on the interactions among biochar, soil and Hg under redox conditions are highlighted. Furthermore, the existing problems with the use of biochar to treat Hg-contaminated soils and sediments, such as the appropriate dose and the long-term effectiveness of biochar, are discussed. Further research involving laboratory tests and field applications is necessary to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the role of biochar in reducing Hg bioavailability in diverse soil types under varying redox conditions and to develop completely green and sustainable biochar-based functional materials for mitigating Hg-related health risks.",Biochar,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42773-021-00087-1' target='_blank'>10.1007/s42773-021-00087-1</a>,,What effect does biochar application have on mobility of inorganic mercury and bioavailability of methylmercury in mercury contaminated soils?,3,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,Evidence Review

However, translocations often fail. To improve their effectiveness, we need to understand the features that distinguish successful from failed translocations. We assembled and analysed a global database of translocations of terrestrial vertebrates (n = 514) to assess the effects of various design features and extrinsic factors on success. We analysed outcomes using standardised metrics: a categorical success/failure classification; and population growth rate. Probability of categorical success and population growth rate increased with the total number of individuals released but with diminishing returns above about 20–50 individuals. Positive outcomes—categorical success and high population growth—were less likely for translocations in Oceania, possibly because invasive species are a major threat in this region and are difficult to control at translocation sites. Rates of categorical success and population growth were higher in Europe and North America than elsewhere, suggesting the key role of context in positive translocation outcomes. Categorical success has increased throughout the 20th century, but that increase may have plateaued at about 75% since about 1990. Our results suggest there is potential for further increase in the success of conservation translocations. This could be best achieved by greater investment in individual projects, as indicated by total number of animals released, which has not increased over time. © 2021 The Author(s)",Global Ecology and Conservation,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01630' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01630</a>,Biodiversity; Global change; Reintroductions; Species conservation; Translocations,What are the effects of different conservation translocation methods on translocation success of terrestrial vertebrates?,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,3,Evidence Review

F.",2021,"The páramos biome of the northern Andes is a collection of high-mountain tropical grassland wetland ecosystems that provides important ecosystem services including hydrological buffering and water supply. Human activities in these ecosystems transform vegetation cover and soil hydro-physical properties, affecting their hydrological performance and water quality and quantity. Here, we conducted a systematic review on the influence of land use (agriculture, livestock grazing, and afforestation) on the hydro-physical properties of páramo soils and analyzed its implications for streamflow buffering. Our review protocol identified 32 relevant papers, from which key hydro-physical properties linked to streamflow variability were available: soil organic matter (SOM), soil organic carbon (SOC), porosity, bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and water retention capacity (WRC). The analysis shows that soils with native cover are characterized by a porous structure that allows a high WRC and SOM content. Agriculture increases macroporosity but it leads to bare fallow plots that promote loss of nutrients and SOM. Burning generates hydrophobic aggregates that affect WRC. Livestock grazing produces soil compaction and increases bulk density, reducing infiltration and WRC. Lastly, afforestation with exotic species (e.g. pines, eucalyptus) decreases SOM and WRC by changing soil structure. In general, the analyzed land-use activities generate hydrophobic aggregates, increase bulk density, promote erosion and runoff, and impair hydrological buffering capacity. This integrated evidence from multiple empirical studies can be used to effectively communicate the effects of different land use practices on páramo soils, provide information for modelling in data-scarce situations, and contribute to decision making processes for land use planning and conservation.",CATENA,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105227' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.catena.2021.105227</a>,,What is the impact of land use on hydro-physical soil properties and streamflow buffering in the Andean páramos,3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,2,2,2,2,Evidence Review
89152,Effects of microplastics on marine copepods.,Bai ZhuoAn; Wang Nan; Wang MingHua,2021,"Microplastic contamination has been considered as a global environmental problem in marine ecosystem. Due to small size (&lt; 5 mm) in overlapping with that of microalgae, microplastics can easily be ingested by a wide range of marine copepods both in the laboratory and in situ. Although many studies have reported adverse effects of microplastics on marine copepods, it still lacks a systematic overview about the bioavailability of microplastics and their potential ecological consequences. As copepods dominate zooplankton biomass and provide an essential trophic link in marine ecosystem, this review indicates the bioavailability and toxicity of microplastics in such taxon depend on the shape, size, abundance, and properties of plastics. Also, ours is purposed to tease out the possible molecular mechanisms behind. Microplastic ingestion is prevalent; they impede food intake, block the digestive tract, and cause physiological stress in copepods (e.g., immune responses, metabolism disorders, energy depletion, behavioral alterations, growth retardation, and reproduction disturbance). Notably, in response to microplastic exposure, the copepods show both species- and stage-specificity. Furthermore, microplastics can serve as vectors of organic contaminants (e.g., triclosan, chlorpyrifos, and dibutyl phthalate) and thus increase their toxicity in marine copepods, consequently aggravating the adverse impacts of microplastics in marine ecosystem. Given that most previous studies have partially used pristine microplastics and their short-term exposure might have undervalued their negative effects, more multigenerational mechanistic researches (for example, via an integration of omics-based technology and phenotypic trait analysis) are urgently required for numerous marine copepods exposed to environmental-characteristics plastics as demonstrated by aged microplastics at environmentally realistic concentrations and added with other environmental pollutants; thus it will not only provide mechanistic insights into the biological impacts of microplastics, but also help make the seawater-benchmark setting and ecological assessment for microplastic pollution in marine environment.",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112243' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112243</a>,,What are the effects of microplastics on marine copepods?,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,Evidence Review

Moreover, it synthesises the current knowledge of the impact of elevated ambient CO2 levels (eCO(2)) and temperatures on physiological processes, and the application of this knowledge in mechanistic crop models. While eCO(2) evidently has a strong impact on photosynthesis and crop water use, it is uncertain how this will work out for the climatic and crop management conditions prevailing in southern Africa. The impact of heat stress on crop reproductive processes and the process of transpiration cooling mitigating heat stress are poorly represented in models, while both process are relevant given the climatic conditions prevailing in southern Africa. Twenty studies assessing the impact of climate change on future yields of crops, mostly maize, have been retrieved. The results suggest that potato, Bambara groundnut and sugarcane yields may improve. No consistent trends for maize and sorghum could be identified.

Understanding the relationship between public urban green spaces' characteristics and human well-being components may assist in future planning and design of these spaces. This study performed a systematic bibliographic review to analyse the relationships between green spaces' specific characteristics and human well-being components. The green spaces characteristics found in 153 articles were divided in four groups: structure, biodiversity, naturalness, and others; while dimensions of human well-being were divided into four groups: health, security, good social relations, and freedom of choice and action. The number of green spaces and their percentage of vegetation cover and size (structure category) improved human well-being, in all aspects, especially in health. Structure and biodiversity are the characteristics most highly rated in the literature. These green spaces' biodiversity and naturalness contribute to human well-being through improvements in health (particularly mental health) and good social relations. The most frequently methods used to assess the relationship of public urban green spaces and human well-being are mainly oriented towards studying perception of the green space's users.

Such health disparities are a major public health issue in several countries around the world. In this systematic review, we examine whether green space shows stronger associations with physical health for disadvantaged groups than for privileged groups. We hypothesize that disadvantaged groups have stronger protective effects from green space because of their greater dependency on proximate green space, as they tend to lack access to other health-promoting resources. We use the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method and search five databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) to look for articles that examine whether socioeconomic status (SES) or race/ethnicity modify the green space-health associations. Based on this search, we identify 90 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. We find lower-SES people show more beneficial effects than affluent people, particularly when concerning public green spaces/parks rather than green land covers/greenness. Studies in Europe show stronger protective effects for lower-SES people versus higher-SES people than do studies in North America. We find no notable differences in the protective effects of green space between racial/ethnic groups.

However, knowledge on broad-scale patterns of ecosystem and organism responses to fires is still scarce. Through a systematic quantitative review of available studies across South America, we assessed fire effects on biodiversity and abundance of different organisms (i.e., plants, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates), plant fitness, and soil properties under four climate types, and time since the last fire (i.e., early and late post fire). We addressed: (1) What fire effects have been studied across South America? (2) What are the overall responses of biodiversity, abundance, fitness, and soil properties to fires? (3) How do climate and time since fire modulate those responses? Results We analyzed 160 articles reporting 1465 fire responses on paired burned and unburned conditions. We found no effect of fire on biodiversity or on invertebrate abundance, a negative effect on woody plant species and vertebrate abundance, and an increase in shrub fitness. Soil in burned areas had higher bulk density and pH, and lower organic matter and nitrogen. Fire effect was significantly more positive at early than at late post fire for plant fitness and for soil phosphorus and available nitrogen. Stronger negative effects in semiarid climate compared to humid warm climate suggest that higher temperatures and water availability allow a faster ecosystem recovery after fire. Conclusions Our review highlights the complexity of the climate-fire-vegetation feedback when assessing the response of soil properties and different organisms at various levels. The resilience observed in biodiversity may be expected considering the large number of fire-prone ecosystems in South America. The recovery of invertebrate abundance, the reduction of the vertebrate abundance, and the loss of nitrogen and organic matter coincide with the responses found in global reviews at early post-fire times. The strength of these responses was further influenced by climate type and post-fire time. Our synthesis provides the first broad-scale diagnosis of fire effects in South America, helping to visualize strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in fire research. It also brings much needed information for developing adequate land management in a continent where fire plays a prominent socio-ecological role.",Fire Ecology,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s42408-021-00100-9' target='_blank'>10.1186/s42408-021-00100-9</a>,,"What is the impact of fire on biodiversity and abundance of different organisms (i.e., plants, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates), plant fitness, and soil properties in South American ecosystems?",3,1,3,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,3,2,2,Evidence Review

L.; Saha, S.; Conlon, K. C.; Manangan, A. P.; Bell, J. E.; Hess, J. J.",2021,"Climate and weather directly impact plant phenology, affecting airborne pollen. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the impacts of meteorological variables on airborne pollen concentrations and pollen season timing. Using PRISMA methodology, we reviewed literature that assessed whether there was a relationship between local temperature and precipitation and measured airborne pollen. The search strategy included terms related to pollen, trends or measurements, and season timing. For inclusion, studies must have conducted a correlation analysis of at least 5 years of airborne pollen data to local meteorological data and report quantitative results. Data from peer-reviewed articles were extracted on the correlations between seven pollen indicators (main pollen season start date, end date, peak date, and length, annual pollen integral, average daily pollen concentration, and peak pollen concentration), and two meteorological variables (temperature and precipitation). Ninety-three articles were included in the analysis out of 9,679 articles screened. Overall, warmer temperatures correlated with earlier and longer pollen seasons and higher pollen concentrations. Precipitation had varying effects on pollen concentration and pollen season timing indicators. Increased precipitation may have a short-term effect causing low pollen concentrations potentially due to 'wash out' effect. Long-term effects of precipitation varied for trees and weeds and had a positive correlation with grass pollen levels. With increases in temperature due to climate change, pollen seasons for some taxa in some regions may start earlier, last longer, and be more intense, which may be associated with adverse health impacts, as pollen exposure has well-known health effects in sensitized individuals.",International Journal of Biometeorology,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-021-02128-7' target='_blank'>10.1007/s00484-021-02128-7</a>,Pollen; Climate; Aeroallergens; Temperature; Precipitation; Meteorology; Biophysics; Environmental Sciences &amp; Ecology; Meteorology &amp; Atmospheric; Sciences; Physiology,What is the impact of meteorological variables (temperature and precipitation) on airborne pollen concentrations and pollen season timing,2,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,3,Evidence Review
89117,"Potential Impact of the Current and Future Climate on the Yield, Quality, and Climate Suitability for Tea Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze : A Systematic Review","Jayasinghe, S. L.; Kumar, L.",2021,"Even though climate change is having an increasing impact on tea plants, systematic reviews on the impact of climate change on the tea system are scarce. This review was undertaken to assess and synthesize the knowledge around the impacts of current and future climate on yield, quality, and climate suitability for tea; the historical roots and the most influential papers on the aforementioned topics; and the key adaptation and mitigation strategies that are practiced in tea fields. Our findings show that a large number of studies have focused on the impact of climate change on tea quality, followed by tea yield, while a smaller number of studies have concentrated on climate suitability. Three pronounced reference peaks found in Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RYPS) represent the most significant papers associated with the yield, quality, and climate suitability for tea. Tea yield increases with elevated CO2 levels, but this increment could be substantially affected by an increasing temperature. Other climatic factors are uneven rainfall, extreme weather events, and climate-driven abiotic stressors. An altered climate presents both advantages and disadvantages for tea quality due to the uncertainty of the concentrations of biochemicals in tea leaves. Climate change creates losses, gains, and shifts of climate suitability for tea habitats. Further studies are required in order to fill the knowledge gaps identified through the present review, such as an investigation of the interaction between the tea plant and multiple environmental factors that mimic real-world conditions and then studies on its impact on the tea system, as well as the design of ensemble modeling approaches to predict climate suitability for tea.

89104,Buzz-Pollinated Crops: A Global Review and Meta-analysis of the Effects of Supplemental Bee Pollination in Tomato,"Cooley, H.; Vallejo-Marín, M.",2021,"Buzz-pollinated plants require visitation from vibration producing bee species to elicit full pollen release. Several important food crops are buzz-pollinated including tomato, eggplant, kiwi, and blueberry. Although more than half of all bee species can buzz pollinate, the most commonly deployed supplemental pollinator, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae; honey bees), cannot produce vibrations to remove pollen. Here, we provide a list of buzz-pollinated food crops and discuss the extent to which they rely on pollination by vibration-producing bees. We then use the most commonly cultivated of these crops, the tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L. (Solanales: Solanaceae), as a case study to investigate the effect of different pollination treatments on aspects of fruit quality. Following a systematic review of the literature, we statistically analyzed 71 experiments from 24 studies across different geopolitical regions and conducted a meta-analysis on a subset of 21 of these experiments. Our results show that both supplemental pollination by buzz-pollinating bees and open pollination by assemblages of bees, which include buzz pollinators, significantly increase tomato fruit weight compared to a no-pollination control. In contrast, auxin treatment, artificial mechanical vibrations, or supplemental pollination by non-buzz-pollinating bees (including Apis spp.), do not significantly increase fruit weight. Finally, we compare strategies for providing bee pollination in tomato cultivation around the globe and highlight how using buzz-pollinating bees might improve tomato yield, particularly in some geographic regions. We conclude that employing native, wild buzz pollinators can deliver important economic benefits with reduced environmental risks and increased advantages for both developed and emerging economies. © The Author(s) 2021.

89111,How human mega-events influence urban airborne PM2.5 pollution: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Li, S.; Lu, S.; Xu, X.; Zhao, N.; Li, A.; Xu, L.",2021,"Air pollution caused by PM2.5 particles is a critical issue for public health that adversely affects people living in urban cities. Short-term Mega-events such as international meetings, sports tournaments, and traditional festivals can profoundly influence the local air quality. However, the extent of these influences and their role in improving or deteriorating the local air quality is still unclear. By collecting relative research from 75 publications based on more than 37 cities worldwide, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We calculated the log response ratio (RR) of the treatment (during) and control periods (before and after) of the Mega-events. The short-term policy control measures enacted during the Mega-Events consisting of meetings caused a significant decline (by −44.06%) in the ambient PM2.5 concentration. The mean daily PM2.5 concentration reduced from more than 100.00 μg/m3 before the events to 60.39 μg/m3, which is below the WHO (World Health Organization) interim target – 1 (75 μg/m3). On the contrary, setting off fireworks during the festival increased the ambient PM2.5 concentrations by 89.57% on average, with a mean daily value of 254.22 μg/m3. The variations in the effects of all event types on the air quality were primarily influenced by the background PM2.5 concentrations, with a negative correlation throughout. Moreover, the impact of events with policy control measures was also influenced by the year of the event, level of control, and location (suburban/urban) of the monitoring sites. Our findings provide evidence of the potential of human intervention on PM2.5 pollution reduction. We further highlight the crucial role of background pollution level in implementing policies during the Mega-events, which can benefit the environmental governance of developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117009' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117009</a>,,What is the impact of human mega-events such as international sports tournaments or meetings on the concentration of urban airborne particulate matter?,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review

Research on vegetation responses to the land application of biosolids has increased in the past 20 years, but there is no consensus on how plant communities respond to biosolids applications. What factors influence productivity and vegetative cover following biosolids application for grassland reclamation? How does the addition of biosolids impact plant community responses?. Location: Global, but predominantly North America and Europe. Methods: To explore vegetative responses following biosolids application, we used a global systematic review and meta-analysis of 59 articles. Our meta-analysis used the log response ratio (LRR) as an effect size for productivity, total cover, species richness, diversity and exotic species abundance and explored covariates addressing various site characteristics and reclamation strategies. Results: We found that across sites, the land application of biosolids significantly increased productivity and cover but had no significant overall effect on species richness, Shannon diversity or exotic species abundance on degraded lands. These increases in the LRR for productivity and vegetative cover were lower on sites that experienced a fire prior to biosolids application. Climatic variables like mean annual temperature were shown to alter the response of vegetative cover, where warmer sites tended to have more positive responses to biosolids. Seeding was found to increase plant cover but decrease species richness early in the reclamation process. Conclusions: This area of research is growing; most of the publications we used come from the last 20 years and were mostly conducted in North America and Europe. While we can build on the present literature, there is clearly room for more research to ensure the process of reclaiming degraded ecosystems using biosolids results in desired plant communities, e.g. high native species diversity.

89091,Seeds and seedlings in a changing world: A systematic review and meta-analysis from high altitude and high latitude ecosystems,"Vázquez-Ramírez, J.; Venn, S.E.",2021,"The early life-history stages of plants, such as germination and seedling establishment, depend on favorable environmental conditions. Changes in the environment at high altitude and high latitude regions, as a consequence of climate change, will significantly affect these life stages and may have profound effects on species recruitment and survival. Here, we synthesize the current knowledge of climate change effects on treeline, tundra, and alpine plants’ early life-history stages. We systematically searched the available literature on this subject up until February 2020 and recovered 835 potential articles that matched our search terms. From these, we found 39 studies that matched our selection criteria. We characterized the studies within our review and performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the extracted meta-data regarding the climatic effects likely to change in these regions, including projected warming, early snowmelt, changes in precipitation, nutrient availability and their effects on seed maturation, seed dormancy, germination, seedling emergence and seedling establishment. Although the studies showed high variability in their methods and studied species, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the extracted data allowed us to detect existing patterns and knowledge gaps. For example, warming temperatures seemed to favor all studied life stages except seedling establishment, a decrease in precipitation had a strong negative effect on seed stages and, surprisingly, early snowmelt had a neutral effect on seed dormancy and germination but a positive effect on seedling establishment. For some of the studied life stages, data within the literature were too limited to identify a precise effect. There is still a need for investigations that increase our understanding of the climate change impacts on high altitude and high latitude plants’ reproductive processes, as this is crucial for plant conservation and evidence-based management of these environments. Finally, we make recommendations for further research based on the identified knowledge gaps. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the generality of this idea is challenged because (i) most studies have been conducted on two economically important forage grasses {tall fescue [Festuca arundinacea (Schreb.) Dumort] and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)}, (ii) endophyte-mediated mechanisms and effects on plant responses to drought have shown to be highly variable across species, and that (iii) symbiosis incidence in plant populations occurring in extremely arid environments is usually low. We question this idea by reviewing the existing information about Epichloë fungal endophyte effects on drought tolerance in cool-season grasses. We combined standard review, vote counting, and calculation of effect sizes to synthesize the literature, identify information gaps, and guide future research. The total number of studies was higher for domesticated than for wild species, a ratio that was balanced when papers with data quality for effect size calculus were considered. After the drought, endophyte-infected plants accumulated more aboveground and belowground biomass than non-infected counterparts, while no effect on tillering was observed. However, these effects remained significant for wild (even on tillering) but not for domesticated species. Interestingly, despite the continuous effort in determining physiological mechanisms behind the endophyte effects, no studies evaluated plant fecundity as a measure of ecological fitness nor vital rates (such as survival) as to escalate individual-level variables to population. Together with the high variability in results, our work shows that generalizing a positive effect of fungal endophytes in plant tolerance to drought may be misleading. Future studies combining field surveys with manipulative experiments would allow us to unravel the role of fungal endophytes in plant adaptation by considering the evolutionary history of species and populations to the different ecological contexts. © Copyright © 2021 Decunta, Pérez, Malinowski, Molina-Montenegro and Gundel.",Frontiers in Plant Science,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.644731' target='_blank'>10.3389/fpls.2021.644731</a>,abiotic stress; domesticated grasses; meta-analysis; mutualism; symbiosis; water shortage; wild grasses,What is the effect of Epichloë Fungal Endophytes on drought tolerance in cool-season grasses?,3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,Evidence Review

The status of these arthropods in the subsequent cash crop depends on several factors such as CC species, management, biomass production, and weather conditions. A systematic review was performed to identify how CC management influences pest and beneficial arthropods and to identify knowledge gaps for the future research efforts. Eight studies included in this review indicated that CC increase beneficial arthropods or some beneficial arthropods compared with the CC managed fields. A minority of the studies indicated an increase in pest presence when using CC. Cover crop species, termination time and methods, and CC management had variable responses on arthropod activity-density. The variable responses, differences on study designs, and complexity of CC management influence arthropod activity in a CC-corn [Zea mays L. (Poaceae)]/soybean [Glycine max L.

Here, we assessed the impact of anthropogenic interventions, including crop diversification in rotations, soil physical disturbance, synthetic chemical inputs, and biofertilizer use on soil microbial community structure and function, and the consequential effects on agroecosystem productivity and environmental sustainability. Summarizing the results of over 160 medium- to long-term experiments from various soil-climatic zones across the globe in this review illustrated that (1) increasing crop diversification in rotations could bring positive impacts on soil microorganisms and soil health, especially including legume crops in rotations. (2) However, monocultures such as continuous wheat cropping could negatively impact soil health by enhancing activities of host specific pathogens. (3) Physical agronomic practices such as tillage can alter soil microbial communities by shifting microclimate conditions. (4) Mineral nitrogen fertilizer use, a leading nutrient input, may have exceeded the planetary boundary of N cycling, and is causing soil acidification and decreasing microbial biomass. (5) Synthetic chemicals, essential for disease management (pesticides) and yield sustainability (fertilization) in conventional agroecosystems are often toxic to non-target soil microorganisms, while bio-fungicides and biofertilizers—a more sustainable approach—carry significant risks to trigger succession of the native soil microbial community, thus impacting soil health.

89071,Factors affecting usage of crossing structures by wildlife – A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Denneboom, D.; Bar-Massada, A.; Shwartz, A.",2021,"Wildlife crossing structures (WCS) are widely used to allow for safe animal movement across roads, promoting both human safety and wildlife conservation. These structures are expensive to build and maintain, and therefore cost-effective design is essential. Although there has been much research to date on the factors affecting the usage of WCS by wildlife, no attempt has been made to synthesize these results and assess the current state of knowledge. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific and professional literature to assess the state of empirical evidence on WCS and a meta-analysis to explore the factors that influence their effectiveness. We identified a total of 270 studies that reported empirical results spanning four decades of research. Most studies (161) measured the number of crossing events without monitoring approaches to the structure, thus limiting the ability to assess WCS effectiveness. Only 77 studies measured the proportion of successful crossings to approaches, which was the type of data used for meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis results show that viaducts are the most effective type of WCS for large mammals. For example, the odds of ungulates crossing through a viaduct are 2.9 times that of an overpass, and 3.6 times that of an underpass. WCS built specifically for wildlife are used significantly more than those built for dual use by humans and wildlife. For large carnivores, the odds of using a dedicated WCS are 15.9 times that of a structure used concurrently by humans. We additionally found that natural materials and round shapes are preferable in the design of effective WCS. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of adopting large-scale monitoring of wildlife crossing structures. More broadly, we conclude that further research focusing on under-studied species and structure characteristics is needed to facilitate cost-effective mitigation efforts that reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions and promote wildlife conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146061' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146061</a>,,What is the comparative effectiveness of different structural and spatial attributes of wildlife crossing structures for use by wildlife populations?,4,2,3,3,4,1,2,2,1,3,2,1,4,2,2,2,Evidence Review

Studies examining the outcomes of old field restoration predominantly focus on plant, and sometimes, vertebrate communities. Fewer studies have systematically investigated the effects of restoration efforts on soil properties or ground-dwelling invertebrates and there is limited synthesis of these data. We conducted a global meta-analysis of published studies to assess the effects of old field restoration on soil properties and soil invertebrate abundance and richness. We anticipated increased vegetation cover would improve soil properties towards reference condition and in turn, this would promote invertebrate abundance and richness. Studies were included if field sites had a history of cropping or livestock grazing. We identified 42 studies (1994–2019) from 16 countries that met our criteria. More studies assessed passive restoration methods than active planting, and native species were more commonly planted than exotic species. Results showed that restoration improved soil conditions with respect to total nitrogen, magnesium, soil carbon, bulk density and porosity when compared to controls; however, conditions similar to those in reference ecosystems were generally not achieved, even 50+ years after restoration had been initiated. Moderator analyses showed few significant tends, however, bulk density improved with age, and in passively restored versus reference ecosystems. Outcomes for soil carbon and bulk density were most predominant in the top soil when compared to the degraded ecosystem. We detected no consistent trends for the effect of restoration on soil invertebrate richness and abundance compared to the control or reference ecosystems. Synthesis and applications. Our global meta-analysis found strong evidence that old field restoration in agricultural landscapes had positive effects on soil condition but did not lead to full recovery when compared to a reference ecosystem.

While plantations support less biodiversity compared to natural forests, they can serve as an important habitat for forest-dependent species. Understanding the key drivers of the habitat function of plantations is necessary to reconcile both forestry and biodiversity. Planted tree species is one of the important factors determining biodiversity of plantations. Here, we systematically collected studies comparing the biodiversity between conifer plantations and natural forests, and conducted meta-analyses to quantify the effects of planted tree family/species (cypress family: Japanese cedar Cryptomeria japonica, Hinoki cypress Chamaecyparis obtuse; pine family: Japanese larch Larix kaempferi, Japanese red pine Pinus densiflora, Todo fir Abies sachalinensis) on abundance and species richness of a wide range of taxa (all taxa, vertebrates, birds, invertebrates, terrestrial arthropods, plants, and understorey plants) in plantations in Japan. Abundance and species richness in plantations relative to natural forests differed among planted tree family/species. In plantations of pine family (mainly larch), abundance or richness did not significantly differ from those in natural forests for many taxa, suggesting the important role as habitats. By contrast, in cypress family (mainly cedar), abundance or richness was significantly lower than in natural forests for all analysis groups except understorey abundance. These results indicate that the habitat function of plantations and its management should be considered for each planted tree species, separately.

However, little is known about the mechanisms and pathways that link blue spaces and health. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarise the evidence and quantify the effect of blue spaces on four hypothesised mediating pathways: physical activity, restoration, social interaction and environmental factors. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted using six databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCOHOST/CINAHL). Fifty studies were included in our systematic review. The overall quality of the included articles, evaluated with the Qualsyst tool, was judged to be very good, as no mediating pathway had an average article quality lower than 70%. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for physical activity, restoration and social interaction. Living closer to blue space was associated with statistically significantly higher physical activity levels (Cohen’s d = 0.122, 95% CI: 0.065, 0.179). Shorter distance to blue space was not associated with restoration (Cohen’s d = 0.123, 95% CI: −0.037, 0.284) or social interaction (Cohen’s d = −0.214, 95% CI: −0.55, 0.122). Larger amounts of blue space within a geographical area were significantly associated with higher physical activity levels (Cohen’s d = 0.144, 95% CI: 0.024, 0.264) and higher levels of restoration (Cohen’s d = 0.339, 95% CI: 0.072, 0.606). Being in more contact with blue space was significantly associated with higher levels of restoration (Cohen’s d = 0.191, 95% CI: 0.084, 0.298). There is also evidence that blue spaces improve environmental factors, but more studies are necessary for meta-analyses to be conducted. Evidence is conflicting on the mediating effects of social interaction and further research is required on this hypothesised pathway.

89046,Efficacy of Vermiremediation to Remove Contaminants from Soil,"Dada, E. O.; Akinola, M. O.; Owa, S. O.; Dedeke, G. A.; Aladesida, A. A.; Owagboriaye, F. O.; Oludipe, E. O.",2021,"Background. In addition to improving soil fertility and crop production, earthworms have been found to be useful in the removal of contaminants from soil, known as vermiremediation. Previous studies on vermiremediation have focused primarily on organic wastes, with relatively less attention paid to inorganic contaminants. In addition, some basic terms used in environmental health studies have often not been properly clarified. Objectives. The present study is a review of the state of the literature on the effectiveness of using earthworms to remediate organic and inorganic (metal) soil contaminants. Earthworms' actions in remediation of organic and inorganic contaminants are described. Some terms that are used interchangeably in environmental health are clarified. The challenges and limitations of vermiremediation are highlighted. Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted to access online academic publications indexed in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Clarivate Analytics (Web of Science), ScienceDirect, ResearchGate and Springer Link. A total of 165 publications on the subject matter were accessed, out of which 47 were used for the review. Discussion. Empirical and theoretical information from the literature showed evidence of the significant contributions of earthworms to the removal of soil organic contaminants and metals. Earthworms indirectly facilitate the conversion of organic contaminants by promoting microbial and enzyme activities. Some organic contaminants are directly taken up through dermal and intestinal absorption and accumulated by preferential sequestration in sub-organismic and tissue fractions of earthworms. Metals are directly removed and accumulated by the mechanism of detoxification and sequestration, via metallothioneins induction. The terms `contaminants' and `pollutants' have different meanings and should not be used interchangeably. Although vermiremediation presents an ideal clean-up technique, it is limited in application to only mildly contaminated soil environments. Ethical concerns should not pose a serious issue because vermiremediation simply takes advantage of earthworms' natural soil-conditioning abilities. Many vermiremediation processes, especially of organic wastes, are harmless to earthworms, improving the soil for their growth and survival. Conclusions. Vermiremediation presents a good long-term biological option to clean up mildly contaminated soil. It may be deployed as a secondary measure to rid the soil of residual contaminants after applying physicochemical remediation techniques to an overtly polluted soil environment.",Journal of Health and Pollution,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.5696/2156-9614-11.29.210302' target='_blank'>10.5696/2156-9614-11.29.210302</a>,,What is the effectiveness of using earthworms to remove organic and inorganic soil contaminants?,2,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,Evidence Review

Soil surface mulching with plastic film has been widely used to improve soil water availability in the Loess Plateau of China. However, a systematic assessment on soil water balance dynamics under plastic mulching is still lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis on plastic mulching observations across the Loess Plateau to quantify the intensity of evapotranspiration (ET), spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water storage (SWS), and annual soil water balance in the plastic mulching systems. The results indicated that compared with non-mulching, plastic mulching significantly enhanced ET by 2.6% across the entire dataset. The magnitude of intensified ET was strongly associated with mulching pattern, mean annual precipitation and nitrogen application. Plastic mulching led to a significant increase in SWS by 8.4% at 0-60 cm soil layer, yet a decrease by 0.8% at 60-200 cm layer over the growing season, comparing with non-mulching. Importantly, an effective water recovery effect was observed at the deep soil layer under plastic mulching, as evidenced by the significantly greater SWS (+30%) over the fallow season, in comparison with that of non-mulching. Nitrogen input level and mean annual precipitation proved to be the most important factors in driving SWS. As a result, crop yield and water use efficiency were substantially improved under plastic mulching, and such enhancements were the most pronounced under full plastic mulching and lower annual mean precipitation. Increased vegetation growth due to plastic mulching can turn to impact soil water dynamics in both growing and fallow seasons, but it did not disrupt the annual equilibrium of SWS. Particularly, more precipitation storage at deep soil layer during the non-growing season appeared to fully offset the extra water loss by enhanced ET. Our findings provide critical insight into the success of plastic mulching farming practice regarding field productivity and soil water sustainability.","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107354' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agee.2021.107354</a>,,"What are the effects of plastic mulching on the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water storage, crop yield and water use efficiency in the Loess Plateau, China?",2,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review

Energy efficiency has implications beyond usage and costs, with various co-benefit outcomes such as improved household health and well-being, comfort, air quality, increased productivity, energy security and improved social capital. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to examine energy efficiency interventions in advanced economies focusing on the household and determine the level of evidence regarding their effectiveness. We broadly scrutinise literature from 1990 to November 2019 to determine how theory and frameworks are used (or not used) to inform household interventions, the populations or groups of focus, which techniques and activities are used, and how outcomes are measured. We find mixed evidence to support specific types of interventions; however, when multiple techniques and activities were used, the intervention's success was more likely. We conclude with policy implications that call for more integrated and methodical explanations of interventions to better support critical decision-making for government.",Energy Policy,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112136' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112136</a>,Systematic literature review; Household energy efficiency; Interventions; Campaigns; Effectiveness; Evidence-based policy and practice (EBPP),What is the effectiveness of household energy efficiency interventions for increasing household energy efficiency?,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,3,1,2,3,Evidence Review
89031,Do protected areas matter? A systematic review of the social and ecological impacts of the establishment of protected areas,"Ma, B.; Zhang, Y.; Hou, Y.; Wen, Y.",2020,"There is growing interest in evaluating the effects of establishing protected areas (PAs). However, the mechanisms through which the establishment of PAs achieved significant positive effects remain unclear, and how different conservation mechanisms have achieved significant positive social and ecological benefits has also not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we systematically reviewed exemplary cases from Asia, Africa, and South America, using panel data to assess the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves and national parks. By surveying 629 literature samples reported in 31 studies, we found that the establishment of PAs has positive influences on poverty reduction, family incomes, household expenditure, employment, forest cover, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and a reduction in forest fragmentation. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific aspects that influence the publication of a paper in a high-impact journal. We found that publication is more likely when the research uses panel data, matching methods of data analysis, large samples, and plots or PAs as research units and has significant evaluation results. Our results suggest that future studies should use panel data and matching method analysis to assess the impacts of PAs from multiple perspectives and focus on the effectiveness of specific conservation mechanisms in achieving positive effects. © 2020 by the authors.

89020,Implications of land management practices on selected ecosystem services in the agricultural landscapes of Ethiopia: a review,"Biratu, A. A.; Bedadi, B.; Gebrehiwot, S. G.; Hordofa, T.; Asmamaw, D. K.; Melesse, A. M.",2021,"Human-induced land degradation and impairment of ecosystem services (ES) are among the serious problems in Ethiopia due to excessive pressure on land and water resources. Thus, various land management (LM) practices have been done to enhance ES and environmental sustainability. However, very little is known about the influence of efficacious LM practices on multiple ES. This study aims at assessing the implication of LM practices on crop yield, soil carbon stock, soil fertility, soil moisture, runoff, soil loss, nutrient loss, and cultural/societal services. A systematic review and synthesis methods were employed. Predefined criteria were used to screen relevant articles; thereby, 572 observations from 94 studies were extracted and synthesized. The results showed that agronomic practices increased grain yields, soil carbon stock, soil fertility, and soil moisture on average by 28, 29, 43 and 14%, respectively. Biological practices regulated runoff, soil loss, and nutrient loss on average by 46, 59 and 94%, respectively. Overall, LM practices were efficacious to enhance delivery of ES bundles but soil bund and fanyaa juu reduced the grain yield on average by 24 and 22%, respectively. This indicates that there are trade-offs between provisioning and other services like regulating, supporting and cultural under physical structures. However, landscape-level collective impact of different LM practices exhibited without any ES trade-offs. The integration of properly designed physical structures with agronomic and biological practices is imperative to enhance ES and balance the trade-offs in the agricultural landscapes. Further, it is important to find out alternative combinations of agricultural LM practices and evaluate for ES delivery.",International Journal of River Basin Management,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2020.1870991' target='_blank'>10.1080/15715124.2020.1870991</a>,Agroecosystems; ecosystem services; land management; grain yield; trade-offs; Water Resources,What is the effect of land management practices on ecosystems services in agricultural landscapes of Ethiopia?,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,Evidence Review
89023,Have food supply chain policies improved forest conservation and rural livelihoods? A systematic review,"Garrett, R. D.; Levy, S. A.; Gollnow, F.; Hodel, L.; Rueda, X.",2021,"To address concerns about the negative impacts of food supply chains in forest regions, a growing number of companies have adopted policies to influence their suppliers' behaviors. With a focus on forest-risk food supply chains, we provide a systematic review of the conservation and livelihood outcomes of the mechanisms that companies use to implement their forest-focused supply chain policies (FSPs)-certifications, codes of conduct, and market exclusion mechanisms. More than half of the 37 cases that rigorously measure the outcomes of FSP implementation mechanisms find additional conservation and livelihood benefits resulting from the policies. Positive livelihood outcomes are more common than conservation additionality and most often pertain to improvements in farm income through increases in crop yields on coffee and cocoa farms that have adopted certifications or codes of conduct. However, in some cases certifications lead to a reduction in net household income as farmers increasingly specialize in the certified commodity and spend more on food purchases. Among the five cases that examine conservation and livelihoods simultaneously, there is no evidence of tradeoffs or synergies-most often an improvement in one type of outcome is associated with no change in the other. Interactions with public conservation and agricultural policies influence the conservation gains achieved by all mechanisms, while the marketing attributes of cooperatives and buying companies play a large role in determining the livelihood outcomes associated with certification. Compliance with the forest requirements of FSP implementation mechanisms is high, but challenges to geospatial monitoring and land use related selection biases limit the overall benefits of these policies. Given the highly variable methods and limited evidence base, additional rigorous research across a greater variety of contexts is urgently needed to better understand if and when FSPs can be successful in achieving synergies between conservation and livelihoods.",Environmental Research Letters,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abe0ed' target='_blank'>10.1088/1748-9326/abe0ed</a>,,What is the effect of forest-focused supply chain policies on forest conservation and human livelihoods?,3,1,3,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,2,2,Evidence Review

In this article, the studies on impacts of forest fires on the permafrost environment are reviewed. These studies indicate that forest fires could result in an irreversible degradation of permafrost, successions of boreal forests, rapid losses of soil carbon stock, and increased hazardous periglacial landforms. After forest fires, soil temperatures rise; active layer thickens; the release of soil carbon and nitrogen enhances, and; vegetation changes from coniferous forests to broad-leaved forests, shrublands or grasslands. It may take decades or even centuries for the fire-disturbed ecosystems and permafrost environment to return to pre-fire conditions, if ever possible. In boreal forest, the thickness of organic layer has a key influence on changes in permafrost and vegetation. In addition, climate warming, change of vegetation, shortening of fire return intervals, and extent of fire range and increasing of fire severity may all modify the change trajectory of the fire-impacted permafrost environment. However, the observations and research on the relationships and interactive mechanisms among the forest fires, vegetation, carbon cycle and permafrost under a changing climate are still inadequate for a systematic impact evaluation. Using the chronosequence approach of evaluating the temporal changes by measuring changes in the permafrost environment at different stages at various sites (possibly representing varied stages of permafrost degradation and modes), multi-source data assimilation and model predictions and simulations should be integrated with the results from long- and short-term field investigations, geophysical investigations and airborne surveys, laboratory testing and remote sensing. Future studies may enable quantitatively assess and predict the feed-back relationship and influence mechanism among organic layer, permafrost and active layer processes, vegetation and soil carbon under a warming climate at desired spatial and temporal scales.

This meta-analysis provided a systematic and quantitative result of the relative changes in yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of seven agricultural products (maize, wheat, cotton, potato, tomato, apple and grape) under conventional full irrigation (FULL), APRI and DI globally. Three comparisons were performed: (1) APRI by FULL, (2) APRI by DI and (3) DI by FULL. The results showed that the relative changes of yield and WUE differed among the three comparisons. Higher yield and WUE were achieved in fruits (apple and grape) under APRI compared with FULL or DI. However, the percentage changes in yield and WUE under APRI were not significantly different in vegetables (potato and tomato) and crops (maize, wheat and cotton). Compared with FULL, APRI performed better for acidic soils, clay loam or sandy loam, high bulk density (≥ 1.35 g cm−3), irrigation amount of 80–100% FULL, and was more appropriate for furrow irrigation in drier and colder environments. Compared with FULL, DI performed better for clay loam, low bulk density (&lt; 1.35 g cm−3) and precipitation &gt; 200 mm. Yields under APRI and DI were remarkably lower than those under FULL, while the corresponding WUE were significantly higher. Compared with DI, fruits with furrow irrigation and in soils with clay and sandy loam were better under APRI. There was no significant difference in yield between APRI and DI, but WUE under APRI was higher. APRI increased both yield and WUE in regions with low average annual temperature (&lt; 9 ℃).

Avocado Persea americana benefits from insect pollination, however, a better understanding of the role of pollinators and their contribution to the production of this globally important crop is needed. In this study, we carried out a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies investigating the pollination ecology of avocado to answer the following questions: (a) Are there any research gaps in terms of geographic location or scientific focus? (b) What is the effect of insect pollinators on avocado pollination and production? (c) Which pollinators are the most abundant and effective and how does this vary across location? (d) How can insect pollination be improved for higher yields? (e) What are the current evidence gaps and what should be the focus of future research? Research from many regions of the globe has been published, however, results showed that there is limited information from key avocado producing countries such as Mexico and the Dominican Republic. In most studies, insects were shown to contribute greatly to pollination, fruit set and yield. Honeybees Apis mellifera were important pollinators in many regions due to their efficiency and high abundance, however, many wild pollinators also visited avocado flowers and were the most frequent visitors in over 50% of studies. This study also highlighted the effectiveness of stingless bees (Meliponini) and blow flies (Calliphoridae) as avocado pollinators although, for the majority of flower visitors, there is a lack of data on pollinator efficiency. For optimal yields, growers should ensure a sufficient abundance of pollinators in their orchards either through increasing honeybee hive density or, for a more sustainable approach, by managing wild pollinators through practices that protect or promote natural habitat. © 2021 The Authors.

It is based on a systematic search of literature, covering studies using significance-based hypotheses tests on the relation between fish parameters and cormorant abundance. The results show that extensive research on cormorant diet exists, but few studies use statistical hypotheses testing to examine the effect on fish populations. In total, 603 publications were identified from titles and abstracts, to include the interaction between cormorants and fish. From these, 27 articles tested fish population parameters against cormorant predation, whereof 22 could be included in analyses. The effect size was defined negative in cases when cormorant numbers or presence reduced fish numbers or biomasses, or when individual fish sizes decreased, and vice versa for a positive effect. In a hierarchical dependence model, the combined effect of cormorant predation on fish was negative, but the overall effect was not significant at the 95% confidence level (-0.169, 95% C.L. -0.505 to 0.167, p = .256, df = 5.26).

Although the relationship between affecting factors associated with LULC and soil erosion has been well-documented, a systematic review of LULC for erosion control is lacking. A quantitative synthesis of 1270 runoff and 1302 sediment observations from 79 references covering 57 sites was conducted to assess the effects of LULC on erosion control in the red soil hilly region (RSHR) of southern China. The results indicated that the maximum runoff and soil loss were found in bare land (BL), but the minimum runoff and soil loss were detected in cropland and grassland, respectively. Among the 16 land use subtypes, BL left for natural succession had the highest runoff, but the lowest runoff was found in orchard with contact cover; the soil loss was largest for cropland without conservation measures, while the minimum value was detected in natural shrubland. When the vegetation coverage exceeded 60%, runoff and soil loss both tended to reach a stable rate. Land use with a multi-layer vegetation structure or ground/contact cover or broadleaf plant had less runoff and lower sediment values. In addition, soil loss decreased sharply during the initial 3 y of vegetation restoration, and then slowly declined until reaching a relatively stable rate after 15 y of succession. Our results confirmed that land use (except for BL) has a limited influence on soil erosion provided that suitable land cover is established. This study revealed that sustainable land management measures should be adopted based on local conditions to reduce soil erosion induced by irrational LULC.

However, few reviews have been published summarizing the efficacy of this specific management practice and how it impacts ecosystem service delivery to crops. We conducted a systematic review (54 studies) and meta-analysis (4–29 studies, depending on the response) to determine whether such plantings 1) increase pollinator abundance or richness within field edges, 2) increase the abundance or richness of pollinators visiting crop flowers, or 3) improve crop yields. Our review and meta-analysis suggest that field-edge flower plantings are highly effective at increasing pollinator richness and abundance in field edges and that plantings become more effective as they mature. However, the influence of field-edge plantings on crop pollination and yield is inconsistent. Planting size and richness did not change these results. While this analysis shows that field-edge flower plantings consistently increase pollinator abundance and richness, there remain critical gaps in our knowledge of when and how plantings can improve ecosystem service provision and delivery.

88974,Influence of land use change on rove beetle diversity: A systematic review and global meta-analysis of a mega-diverse insect group,"Méndez-Rojas, D.M.; Cultid-Medina, C.; Escobar, F.",2021,"The global decline in insect diversity is worrisome and little is known about insects’ response to land use change. Rove beetles (Staphylinidae) are megadiverse and a key component in ecosystem functioning as generalist predators in forest habitats and agroecosystems. These beetles are sensitive to environmental changes related to the modification of natural habitats, however there is still no consensus on their usefulness as potential ecological disturbance indicators. Through an exhaustive literature review and a global quantitative analysis, we evaluated the response of rove beetles to land use change in different biogeographic regions to see if these beetles can be used as an ecological disturbance indicator. Using Hill's series (qD), species density and the density of individuals, rove beetle response was evaluated for different types of land use ranging from native habitats to crops and urban zones. Rove beetle density and richness respond negatively to crops and pastures, but urban zones were as diverse as some native habitats. The magnitude of the response varied among biogeographic regions and appears to be related to the life history traits of the species that make up the beetle communities. The high degree of variation observed in the response of rove beetles might result from the lack of information about the influence of the landscape's characteristics on local response. The idea that the simplification of native habitats leads to a reduction in rove beetle density and diversity is partially supported. However, in order to generalize a pattern of rove beetle response to the global scale, it is necessary to standardize the protocol for comparative studies in addition to considering other community attributes (e.g. species composition). The use of Staphylinidae as a potential ecological disturbance indicator in human-dominated landscapes is widely discussed. © 2020 The Authors",Ecological Indicators,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107239' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107239</a>,,What are the effects of land use change on Rove beetles (Staphylinidae) density and richness?,3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review

A systematic review,"Savilaakso, S.; Johansson, A.; Hakkila, M.; Uusitalo, A.; Sandgren, T.; Monkkonen, M.; Puttonen, P.",2021,"Background: Forest harvesting changes forest habitat and impacts forest dependent species. Uneven-aged management is often considered better for biodiversity than even-aged management, but there is an ongoing discourse over the benefits and disadvantages of different silvicultural systems. This systematic review contributes to the public discussion and provides evidence for policy making by synthesising current evidence on impacts of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on biodiversity in boreal forests of Fennoscandia and European Russia. In this review even-aged and uneven-aged forest management are compared directly to each other as well as to natural forest to provide a broad basis for public discussion. Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched in bibliographical databases, organizational webpages and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened for relevance by their title/abstract and again by full text. The inclusion of studies was assessed against pre-defined criteria published in an a priori protocol. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted to describe the evidence base and to compare species richness and abundance between differently managed forests. The influence of habitat specialism, taxon, years since harvesting, deadwood availability and harvesting intensity on species richness and abundance were also tested. Review findings: Searching identified 43,621 articles of which 137 articles with 854 studies had independent data and were included in the narrative synthesis. Of those, 547 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The most studied taxa were arthropods, vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens. Results showed that forests with less disturbance (uneven-aged and mature even-aged) host more forest dependent species than young even-aged forests (< 80 years old) although the difference was only marginally significant for mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old). Uneven-aged forest had similar number of species and individuals than natural forest whereas even-aged forest had less species than natural forest. Open habitat species and their individuals were more numerous in young even-aged forests and forests undergone retention harvest. Effect sizes found were mostly large indicating strong and uniform impact of forest management based on species' habitat preferences. In addition to habitat specialism, years since harvest explained some of the differences found in species richness and abundance due to increase of open habitat species in the early successional stages and forest dependent species in late successional stages. Taxon had limited explanatory power. Conclusions: Habitat preferences determine species' response to different harvesting methods and the magnitude of effect is large. Less disturbance from harvesting is better for forest dependent species whereas opposite is true for open habitat species. Uneven-aged and mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old) are important to maintain biodiversity in boreal forests. However, the results also highlight that natural forests are needed to ensure the future of forest dependent species in Fennoscandia and European Russia.

88948,"Are small protected habitat patches within boreal production forests effective in conserving species richness, abundance and community composition? A systematic review","Hakkila, M.; Johansson, A.; Sandgren, T.; Uusitalo, A.; Monkkonen, M.; Puttonen, P.; Savilaakso, S.",2021,"Background: In boreal zone forest management is changing and degrading forest habitats, which has caused declines in biodiversity. To mitigate these harmful effects in production forests, small-scale habitats with high biodiversity values have been protected within them. These habitats include woodland key habitats, and other small habitat patches protected by voluntary conservation actions. In this systematic review we synthesize the evidence on the value of small protected habitat patches (SPHP) within production forest landscapes for biodiversity. Review question: Are small protected habitat patches within boreal production forests effective in conserving species richness, abundance, and community composition? Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched from bibliographical databases, organizational websites and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened at two stages (title/abstract and full text) and the validity of the included studies were assessed. Screening and validity assessment were based on predetermined criteria. After data extraction, narrative and quantitative syntheses were conducted. Influences of effect modifiers were tested, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Review findings: During the searches 19,458 articles were found. After duplicate removal and title/abstract screening 336 articles remained. During full text screening 41 articles were included and 35 of them (174 studies) were included in narrative synthesis. 28 articles with 127 studies had suitable data for meta-analysis. SPHPs had significantly higher species richness compared to production forests. When compared to natural forests, there was no significant difference. Forest management in areas surrounding SPHPs did not have impact on species richness of these patches. Individual abundance was significantly higher in SPHPs compared to natural or production forests. There was significantly more dead wood in SPHPs compared to production forests, but when compared to natural forests there was no significant difference. Community composition was different between SPHPs and both production and natural forests. Conclusions: The findings of this review show that small protected patches within production forests are important part of biodiversity conservation. They cannot substitute larger protected areas but supplement the protected area network. However, there were gaps both in geographical distribution of the studies as well as in the selection of target species of the studies.

88949,A meta-analysis of anthropogenic impacts on physiological stress in wild primates,"Kaisin, O.; Fuzessy, L.; Poncin, P.; Brotcorne, F.; Culot, L.",2021,"As humanity continues to alter the environment extensively, comprehending the effect of anthropogenic disturbances on the health, survival, and fitness of wildlife is a crucial question for conservation science. Many primate populations occupy suboptimal habitats prone to diverse anthropogenic disturbances that may be sources of acute and chronic stress. Quantification of glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations has repeatedly been used to explore the impact of disturbances on physiological stress. Although it is still debated, prolonged elevation of GC levels may impair reproduction, growth, and immune system activity of individuals. We quantified the effect of anthropogenic disturbances on physiological stress in primates with a global meta-analysis based on data from 26 articles, covering 24 distinct species in 13 different countries. Anthropogenic disturbances were classified into 6 distinct categories: habitat loss, habitat degradation, ongoing logging, hunting, tourism, and other human activities. We calculated effect sizes (Hedges' g) with the standardized mean difference in GC concentrations between primates affected by human activity and their undisturbed conspecifics. We ran random-effects models and subgroup analyses to estimate the overall effect as well as a cumulative effect size for each disturbance category. Overall, primates inhabiting sites subject to anthropogenic disturbances exhibited significantly higher GC levels (g = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.28-0.93). Habitat loss and hunting were overall associated with increased GC concentrations, whereas the cumulative effects of the other disturbances were not statistically significant. Biologically, high GC levels may increase fitness by enabling individuals to overcome the challenges linked to anthropogenic disturbances. However, primates in disturbed environments may have sustained elevated GC levels. To strengthen future research, it is necessary to control confounding factors systematically (e.g., diet, reproductive status, predatory pressure, and resource availability) and improve understanding of the link between GC levels and the health, fitness, and survival of animals.",Conservation Biology,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13656' target='_blank'>10.1111/cobi.13656</a>,,What is the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on glucocorticoid levels in primates?,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,2,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,2,Evidence Review
88938,"A systematic analysis and review of the impacts of afforestation on soil quality indicators as modified by climate zone, forest type and age","Guo, Y.; Abdalla, M.; Espenberg, M.; Hastings, A.; Hallett, P.; Smith, P.",2020,"This global systematic analysis and review investigate the impacts of previous land use system, climate zone, forest type and forest age on soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) stock, soil bulk density (BD) and pH at soil layers 0–20, 20–60 and 60–100 cm, following afforestation. Data came from 91 publications on SOC, TN and TP stock changes, covering different countries and climate zones. Overall, afforestation significantly increased SOC by 46%, 52% and 20% at 0–20, 20–60 and 60–100 cm depths, respectively. It also significantly increased shallower TN stocks by 28% and 22% at 0–20 and 20–60 cm depths, respectively, but had no overall impacts on TP. Previous land use system had the largest influence on SOC, TN and TP stock changes, with greater accumulations on barren land compared to cropland and grassland. Climate zone influenced SOC, TN and TP stock changes, with greater accumulations for moist cool than other climate zones. Broadleaf forests were better than coniferous forests for increasing SOC, TN and TP stocks of the investigated soil profile (0–100 cm). Afforestation for <20 years accumulated SOC and TN stocks only at the soil surface (0–20 cm), whilst afforestation for >20 years accumulated SOC and TN stocks to 100 cm soil depth. Changes to SOC and TN were positively correlated at depths down to 100 cm under all age groups, demonstrating that an increase TN could offset progressive N limitation, and maintains SOC accumulation as forests age. TP stock decreased significantly in topsoil (0–20 cm) for <20-year-old forest and did not change for >20-year-old forest, suggesting that it may become a limiting factor for carbon sequestration as forests age. Following afforestation, soil BD decreased alongside significant increases in SOC and TN stocks to 100 cm depth, but had no relationship with TP. © 2020",Science of the Total Environment,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143824' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143824</a>,,"What are the impacts of afforestion on soil organic properties and nutrients of different land use systems, climate zone, forest type and forest age?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review
88925,Application of controlled release urea improved grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency: A meta-analysis,"Zhu, S.; Liu, L.; Xu, Y.; Yang, Y.; Shi, R.",2020,"The application of controlled release urea (CRU) has been proposed as a crucial method to reduce the adverse environmental effects induced by conventional urea (CU). Yet, a systematic and quantitative analysis on how CRU affects staple crop production including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) is lacking. Here, a meta-analysis was conducted to determine how CRU influences soil chemical properties, total nitrogen (TN) uptake, grain yield, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of staple crop in China. The results indicated that CRU application significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC), TN, and available nitrogen (AN) by 5.93%, 3.89% and 13.98% respectively overall, while soil pH showed no significant changes. Compared to the application of CU, applying CRU significantly increased grain yield by 7.23%, which was mainly owing to the higher TN uptake (9.13%) across all the studies. In addition, the application of CRU significantly increased NUE, nitrogen agronomy efficiency (NAE), utilization rate of nitrogen fertilizer (NUR), and nitrogen physiological efficiency (NPE) by an average of 23.4%, 34.65%, 25.83% and 15.8% respectively which could be attributed to the slow nitrogen (N) release characteristics of CRU. The positive effect of CRU on grain yield and NUE of staple crop was greatest when the content of SOC and TN were extremely low, indicating that it was most effective to improve grain production of infertile soil by applying CRU. The finding of this study indicated that the application of CRU should be promoted for grain production, especially for infertile soil. © 2020 Zhu et al.

88904,Perennial rhizomatous grasses: Can they really increase species richness and abundance in arable land?—A meta-analysis,"Lask, J.; Magenau, E.; Ferrarini, A.; Kiesel, A.; Wagner, M.; Lewandowski, I.",2020,"Perennial rhizomatous grasses (PRG), such as miscanthus and switchgrass, are considered promising lignocellulosic feedstocks. Their cultivation is expected to experience a significant increase in the near future, as it offers a wide range of benefits. For instance, when PRG replace typical annual crops, positive biodiversity impacts are usually anticipated. However, to date, there is no solid, statistically strong evidence for this hypothesis. This study aims to evaluate its validity through a meta-analysis based on an extensive systematic literature review of research comparing biodiversity attributes in PRG and common annual crops. Dynamics of species richness and abundance in response to PRG cultivation were quantitatively evaluated drawing on 220 paired comparisons from 25 studies. This includes data on five taxonomic groups—arthropods, birds, earthworms, mammals and plants—and three PRG—miscanthus, switchgrass and reed canary grass. The results indicate that biodiversity tends to be higher in PRG cultivations relative to the reference crops, but the initial hypothesis of significantly beneficial impacts could not be confirmed. Trends were specific to the individual taxonomic groups: significantly higher biodiversity was found for plants and small mammals. Positive but insignificant trends were observed for arthropods and birds, while earthworm response was neutral and insignificant. More substantial conclusions could not be drawn, which is mainly due to the low number of studies conducting biodiversity assessments in PRG cultivations that included a comparison with annual crops. In addition, a detailed analysis of the observed responses was impaired by poor reporting of the parameters influencing biodiversity in the studies reviewed, such as planting and crop density, as well as yields. For this reason, we conclude with a call for improved data reporting in biodiversity assessments of PRG cultivations and detail requirements for future biodiversity research. © 2020 The Authors.

A review,"Namatsheve, T.; Cardinael, R.; Corbeels, M.; Chikowo, R.",2020,"Intercropping is a common practice among farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, regarded as a sustainable way of improving land productivity to meet food and nutritional requirements for a growing population, especially in marginal areas. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculataL.Walp) is often intercropped with major cereal crops, maize (Zea maysL.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolorL. Moench) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum). Here we conducted a systematic literature review on cowpea intercropped with maize, sorghum or pearl millet reported in sub-Saharan Africa with the objectives (i) to determine yield and productivity of component crops and (ii) to quantify biological N-2-fixation in sole or intercrops. We retrieved 60 unique publications combining 1196, 998 and 25 observations of yields, land productivity and N-2-fixation, respectively, for crops grown as intercrops and monocrops. The major results are as follows: (1) land productivity of cowpea intercropped with maize, sorghum and pearl millet is favourable, with average land equivalent ratios of 1.42 +/- 0.47, 1.26 +/- 0.35 and 1.30 +/- 0.32, respectively; (2) no significant differences between the proportion of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) for sole or intercropped cowpea were found, with average values of 56.00 +/- 4.89 and 46.62 +/- 7.05, respectively; (3) however, the total amount of fixed nitrogen was higher in cowpea monocropping systems due to higher biomass production; nitrogen fixation was 57 kg N ha(-1)and 36 kg N ha(-1)in monocrops and intercrops respectively. We conclude that cereal-cowpea intercropping is a pathway for intensification for the low nutrient input systems of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.

88885,A systematic review of the leaf traits considered to contribute to removal of airborne particulate matter pollution in urban areas,"Corada, K.; Woodward, H.; Alaraj, H.; Collins, C.M.; de Nazelle, A.",2020,"Global urban planning has promoted green infrastructure (GI) such as street trees, shrubs or other greenspace in order to mitigate air pollution. Although considerable attention has been paid to understanding particulate matter (PM) deposition on GI, there has been little focus on identifying which leaf traits might maximise airborne PM removal. This paper examines existing literature to synthesize the state of knowledge on leaf traits most relevant to PM removal. We systematically reviewed measurement studies that evaluated particulate matter accumulated on leaves on street trees, shrubs green roofs, and green walls, for a variety of leaf traits. Our final selection included 62 papers, most from field studies and a handful from wind tunnel studies. The following were variously promoted as useful traits: coniferous needle leaves; small, rough and textured broadleaves; lanceolate and ovate shapes; waxy coatings, and high-density trichomes. Consideration of these leaf traits, many of which are also associated with drought tolerance, may help to maximise PM capture. Although effective leaf traits were identified, there is no strong or consistent evidence to identify which is the most influential leaf trait in capturing PM. The diversity in sampling methods, wide comparison groups and lack of background PM concentration measures in many studies limited our ability to synthesize results. We found that several ancillary factors contribute to variations in the accumulation of PM on leaves, thus cannot recommend that selection of urban planting species be based primarily on leaf traits. Further research into the vegetation structural features and standardization of the method to measure PM on leaves is needed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

However, today there is a general lack of knowledge and little consensus on how land-use changes affect amphibians and reptiles. In order to fill this gap, here we conduct the most comprehensive systematic quantitative review of primary research to date. By means of hierarchical meta-analyses we assessed the effects of the most common land-use changes (agriculture, cattle-raising, urbanization, deforestation, silviculture and selective logging) on the richness of amphibian and reptile communities. Our results show that almost all of the analyzed types of land-use changes have negative effects on these groups, but with different degree of magnitude. We also show that the time elapsed in disturbed conditions does not ameliorate the effects on species richness, indicating a low recovery capacity of herp communities. Another important finding is that the richest communities are the most negatively affected ones, varying the response according to the type of biome. Our synthesis provides updated empirical evidence indicating that current prevalent human land-use changes strongly reduce the richness of amphibian and reptile species as well as revealing important knowledge gaps in certain biomes of the world.

Particularly, microplastics (primary and secondary) are present in all environmental compartments and this poses a potential threat because of their entry into the food chain. Furthermore, microplastics can absorb numerous pollutants that can be accumulated in the human body through bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes. We carried out a systematic review using a PRISMA approach to verify the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for microplastic removal. The international databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus) were used to find published studies on efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for microplastic removal. The search period was between January 2010 and June 2020. Over 1000 full research papers were initially selected through the use of keywords. After that, the papers were further selected by English language, title, and abstract, and duplicate papers and non-relevant papers were eliminated according to eligibility criteria. Finally, we included 15 full research papers. In each of the 15 full research papers selected, the microplastics identified were categorized by the authors for shape, size, and type of polymers identified. The characterization of the various types of microplastics was performed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) or Raman spectroscopy. We have observed how wastewater treatments plants located in different continents (Europe, Asia, North America) mostly use a primary and secondary type of treatment that allows one to reach a high percentage of microplastics removal from wastewater. Most of the wastewater treatments plants investigated reported a microplastics removal efficiency greater than 90%, but despite this, millions of microplastics continue to be released every day into the aquatic environment. Then, in the near future, efficient and common standardized protocols for monitoring MPs should be drawn up, as well as increasing the knowledge of sources and strategies to further reduce microplastics contamination of treated wastewater. © 2020 by the authors.

88863,The role of ‘nativeness’ in urban greening to support animal biodiversity,"Berthon, K.; Thomas, F.; Bekessy, S.",2021,"The classification of plant species as native or exotic has ramifications for how they are treated within urban green space policy and practice. Green spaces are built or managed to fulfil a range of ecological and social functions, and decisions must be made about which plants to include to achieve these functions. There is growing literary and policy emphasis on native-only planting strategies, under the assumption that native species will deliver a greater range of biodiversity benefits. Yet, there remains a disconnection between theoretical debates on the definition or value of nativeness, and urban design practice. Using a systematic review, we examine the relationship between plant nativeness and animal biodiversity in urban areas. We argue that both the use and definition of native species involve value-laden decisions. The social roots of ‘native’ definitions have led to ambiguity in its use within the literature. Despite this ambiguity, we find that most studies show a positive influence of native plants on at least one measure of biodiversity, justifying their priority in urban plantings to support native animals. We conclude with considerations for the selection of plants for urban greening to promote native biodiversity: 1) the resources a plant provides are more important than its origin, but 2) when in doubt, ‘nativeness’ is a good surrogate of whether a plant will provide for local animals, and allows for the conservation of plants themselves; and 3) flexibility in scale of provenance allows for strategic responses to changing climates or competing objectives of urban design. © 2020 The Authors",Landscape and Urban Planning,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103959' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103959</a>,,What is the effect of plant origin on biodiversity in urban green space?,3,1,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,2,2,Evidence Review

Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and agricultural wastes is widely applied to stabilize the substrate and capture some of its energetic value via biogas production. Anaerobic digestate is a concentrated source of nutrients to which nutrient recovery technologies can be applied. By combining anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery technologies on the digestate, both energy and nutrient recovery can be achieved. Two promising technologies that could increase nutrient recycling from different types of wastewater are struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping. This review examined the effectiveness of these ecotechnologies for the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus from anaerobic digestate with the aim of reducing the impact of waste on the environment. Methods: We searched for academic and grey literature published after 2013. Searches were performed in 5 bibliographic databases in English, in the search engine Google Scholar in English, Swedish, Finnish and Polish, and across a range of organisational websites in English, Swedish, Finnish and Polish. Eligibility screening was conducted at two levels: 'title and abstract' and 'full text'. Included eligible studies were subject to a critical appraisal that assessed external and internal study validity. We extracted information on study characteristics, intervention, comparators, effect modifiers, and measured outcomes. Data synthesis included narrative synthesis of each study of sufficient validity. We performed quantitative synthesis on a subset of studies. Review findings: The review included 30 studies on struvite precipitation and 8 studies on ammonia stripping. Both pH and Mg:PO4 ratio were found to have a clear influence on the effectiveness of struvite precipitation process (and thus nutrient removal rates). The response to pH was found to be non-linear, resembling a bell curve with a maximum around pH 9.5. Mg:PO4 ratio was found to have a positive effect on removal up to a ratio as high as 4:1. However, it should be noted that high removal efficiencies were sometimes achieved at a ratio as low as 1:1 as well. Although the effects of pH and Mg:PO4 ratio were clear, the model developed could not accurately predict removal based on these two parameters alone. Studies on ammonia stripping were relatively heterogeneous. Due to the small size of the evidence base, and the heterogeneity between studies, no conclusions are presented regarding the influence of different process parameters on the outcome of ammonia stripping. Conclusions: In conclusion, when performed under the right conditions (i.e. pH around 9.5 and Mg:PO4 ratio of at least 1:1), available evidence suggests that struvite precipitation is an effective technology for the recovery of nutrients from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate. The evidence base is limited for ammonia stripping.

Using shade trees might protect against temperature variability, erosion and excessive radiation but there may be trade-offs in productivity and quality. While impacts of shade trees on arabica (Coffea arabica) have been reviewed, a global synthesis on robusta (Coffea canephora) coffee is lacking. We assessed how shade affects robusta growth and productivity, and what are the interactions and trade-offs. We conducted a systematic literature search in Web of Science and CAB Abstracts on 16 December 2019. Thirty papers fulfilled our inclusion criteria of being experimental studies on the impact of overstory trees with approximately half being from Brazil or India. Shade improved robusta tree growth and yield with some contrasting effects on physicochemical and biochemical properties. Shade (> 30%) was associated with reduced beverage quality. Significant interactions between shade and location, rainfall level and robusta clone were found. Among the clones tested, 06V, C153, LB1, GG229 and JM2 showed a higher productivity and growth (from + 17 to + 280%) under moderate shade (41–65%). This is the first meta-analysis of the effects of shade on robusta coffee. By synthesizing data from different studies, we highlight for the first time that the effect of shade on robusta coffee depends on tree age. Shade had positive impacts on older robusta trees (mean of 16 years), while the impact of shade on younger trees was either insignificant or negative. We highlight the importance of both clone type and tree ages.

88843,The effect of Bt crops on soil invertebrates: a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis,"Krogh, P.H.; Kostov, K.; Damgaard, C.F.",2020,"The ongoing debate about the ecological effects of Bt-crops calls for thorough reviews about the impact on soil biodiversity and their ecosystem services. Transgenic Bt-crops have been genetically modified by inserting a Bacillus thuriengensis gene so the plant expresses a Cry toxin aimed for insect crop pests. Non-target soil invertebrates are particularly recognized for their contribution to plant nutrient availability and turnover of organic matter and it is therefore relevant to protect these invertebrate taxa. A number of studies have compared the population abundance and biomass of soil invertebrates in agricultural fields planted with genetically modified Bt crops and their conventional counterparts. Here, were review and analyze a selection of studies on Protista, nematodes, Collembola, mites, enchytraeids, and earthworms systematically to empower the evidence for asking the question whether population abundances and biomasses of soil invertebrates are changed by Bt crops compared to conventional crops. 6110 titles were captured, of which 38 studies passed our inclusion criteria, and a final number of 22 publications were subject to data extraction. A database with 2046 records was compiled covering 36 locations and the Bt types Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry3Bb1 and Cry3Aa. Comparative effect sizes in terms of Hedges’ g were calculated irrespectively of statistical significance of effects of the source studies. Cry effects on populations were compared across the studies in a meta-analysis employing a hierarchical Bayesian approach of weighted data according to the level of replication. The temporal development of effect sizes was modelled, thereby taking into account the variable duration of the field experiments. There was considerable variation among soil invertebrate orders, but the sample size was insufficient and the sample heterogeneity too large to draw any credible conclusions on the effect of Cry at the order level. However, across orders there was no significant effect of Cry on soil invertebrates. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Transgenic Research,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-020-00213-y' target='_blank'>10.1007/s11248-020-00213-y</a>,Bt crops; Meta-analysis; Non-target organisms; Population changes; Soil invertebrates,What is the effect of transgenic Bt (Bacillus thuriengensis)-crops on population abundances and biomass of soil invertebrates?,3,4,4,3,4,3,2,3,2,4,4,1,3,2,2,1,Evidence Review
88816,Cover cropping enhances soil microbial biomass and affects microbial community structure: A meta-analysis,"Muhammad, I.; Wang, J.; Sainju, U.M.; Zhang, S.; Zhao, F.; Khan, A.",2020,"Cover crops have been increasingly grown for improving soil health and crop production and minimizing environmental impact compared to no cover crop. Systematic documentation of cover cropping effects on soil microbial abundance and community structure, however, is scarce. A meta-analysis including data from 81 available studies was conducted to elucidate the effect of “cover crop” versus “no cover crop” on soil microbial community abundance and structure. Microbial biomass C and N (MBC and MBN) and total phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA) were taken as proxies for soil microbial abundance, and total fungi, total bacteria, gram-positive and -negative bacteria, actinomycete, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for microbial community structure. Compared to no cover crop, cover crop overall enhanced PLFA, MBC, and MBN by 24, 40, and 51%, respectively. Soil total bacteria and total fungi, and the groups in them increased by 7–31% with cove crop compared to no cover crop. Fungi were affected more by cover crop than bacteria as indicated by the greater fungi/bacteria ratio. In depth categorical meta-analyses revealed that the legume and nonlegume cover crop mixture reduced MBC, PLFA, and actinomycete compared to legume or nonlegume cover crop alone. Legume cover crop enhanced actinomycete in comparison to nonlegume or the cover crop mixture. Incorporation of cover crop residue into the soil increased PLFA, total bacteria, AMF root colonization, and spore density, but decreased gram-positive and -negative bacteria and AMF compared to residue placed at the surface or removed from the soil. Microbial parameters due to cover crop compared to no cover crop were related to soil properties and annual precipitation. Medium-textured soils showed greater response of cover crop on PLFA, total bacteria and fungi, and actinomycete than fine- or coarse-textured soils. We conclude that cover crops enhance soil microbial community biomass and affected community structure compared to no cover crop and the responses of microbial parameters to cover crop varied with soil and climatic conditions.

We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the current state of knowledge on forests and freshwater fish in the tropics. The existing evidence is mostly concentrated in the neotropics. The majority of studies provided evidence that fish diversity was higher where there was more forest cover; this was related to the greater heterogeneity of resources in forested environments that could support a wider range of species. Studies quantifying fish abundance (or biomass) showed mixed relationships with forest cover, depending on species-specific habitat preferences. We identify the key challenges limiting our current understanding of the forest–fish nexus and provide recommendations for future research to address these knowledge gaps.

M.; Romanovsky, V. E.",2020,"Erosion along high-latitude coasts has been accelerating in recent decades, resulting in land loss and infrastructure damage, threatening the wellbeing of local communities, and forcing undesired community relocations. This review paper evaluates the state of practice of current coastal stabilization measures across several coastal communities in northern high latitudes. After considering global practices and those in northern high latitude and arctic settings, this paper then explores new and potential coastal stabilization measures to address erosion specific to northern high-latitude coastlines. The challenges in constructing the current erosion control measures and the cost of the measures over the last four decades in northern high-latitude regions are presented through case histories. The synthesis shows that among the current erosion controls being used at high latitudes, revetments built with rocks have the least reported failures and are the most common measures applied along northern high-latitude coastlines including permafrost coasts, while riprap is the most common material used. For seawalls, bulkheads, and groin systems, reported failures are common and mostly associated with displacement, deflection, settlement, vandalism, and material ruptures. Revetments have been successfully implemented at sites with a wide range of mean annual erosion rates (0.3-2.4 m/year) and episodic erosion (6.0-22.9 m) due to the low costs and easy construction, inspection, and decommissioning. No successful case history has been reported for the non-engineered expedient measures that are constructed in the event of an emergency, except for the expedient vegetation measure using root-wads and willows. Soft erosion prevention measures, which include both beach nourishment and dynamically stable beaches, have been considered in this review. The effectiveness of beach nourishment in Utqiavik, Alaska, which is affected by permafrost, is inconclusive. Dynamically stable beaches are effective in preventing erosion, and observations show that they experience only minor damages after single storm events. The analysis also shows that more measures have been constructed on a spit (relative to bluffs, islands, barrier islands, and river mouths), which is a landform where many Alaskan coastal communities reside. The emerging erosion control measures that can potentially be adapted to mitigate coastal erosion in high-latitude regions include geosynthetics, static bay beach concept, refrigerating techniques, and biogeochemical applications. However, this review shows that there is a lack of case studies that evaluated the performance of these new measures in high-latitude environments. This paper identifies research gaps so that these emerging measures can be upscaled for full-scale applications on permafrost coasts.",Environmental Research Letters,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab9387' target='_blank'>10.1088/1748-9326/ab9387</a>,,What is the effect of current coastal erosion control practises on erosion rate in high latitude communities (particularly Alaska)?,2,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,Evidence Review
88790,Biochar increases soil microbial biomass but has variable effects on microbial diversity: A meta-analysis,"Li, X.; Wang, T.; Chang, S.X.; Jiang, X.; Song, Y.",2020,"Biochar has been extensively studied as a soil amendment for carbon sequestration and for improving soil quality; however, a systematic understanding of the responses of soil microbial biomass and diversity to biochar addition is lacking. Here, a meta-analysis of 999 paired data points from 194 studies shows that biochar increases microbial biomass but has variable effects on microbial diversity. Generally, the effects of biochar on microbial biomass are dependent on biochar properties, while that on microbial diversity is dependent on soil properties. The application of biochar, particularly that produced under low temperature and from nutrient-rich feedstocks, could better increase soil microbial biomass (based on phospholipid fatty acid analysis (MBCPLFA)) and diversity. The increases of total microbial biomass with biochar addition are greater in the field than in laboratory studies, in sandy than in clay soils, and when measured by fumigation-extraction (MBCFE) than by MBCPLFA. The bacterial biomass only significantly increases in laboratory studies and fungal biomass only in soils with pH ≤ 7.5 and soil organic carbon ≤30 g kg−1. The increases in total microbial diversity with biochar addition were greater in acidic and sandy soils with low soil organic carbon content and in laboratory incubation studies. In addition, long-term and low-rate addition of biochar always increases microbial diversity. To better guide the use of biochar as a soil amendment, we suggest that establishing long-term and field studies, using a standard method for measuring microbial communities, on different soil types should be our emphasis in future research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141593' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141593</a>,,What is impact of biochar application on soil microbial biomass and diversity?,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,Evidence Review
88794,Do diverse cover crop mixtures perform better than monocultures? A systematic review,"Florence, A.M.; McGuire, A.M.",2020,"Multi-species cover crop mixtures have been increasing in popularity. It has been hypothesized these mixtures produce more biomass, suppress more weeds, scavenge more N, conserve more soil water, stimulate more soil biology, promote higher yields of subsequent crops, and have higher production stability than the best of their monoculture counterparts. This systematic review synthesizes a growing body of cover crop mixture research to assess, for these metrics, whether cover crop mixtures can perform better than their constituent species when planted alone. Searching three databases, we identified 27 studies which compared cover crop mixtures (containing at least three species) to all their constituent species. The studies contained 119 sampled cover crop plantings that met our eligibility criteria. From these, we extracted 243 full comparisons of the best-performing mixture and best-performing monoculture for the selected metrics. In 88% of these comparisons, the monoculture and mixture performed comparably. In 10% of the comparisons, the monoculture did better, and in 2% of comparisons the mixture performed better. Overall, there are few published studies documenting the superiority of cover crop mixtures over monocultures for our selected metrics. © 2020 The Authors.

T.; Knauss, C.; Peters, M.; Rolf, B.; Weil, A.; Weinstein, C.",2020,"Food security will become increasingly challenged over the coming decades, and sustainable intensification is often touted as an ideal way to increase yields while limiting negative environmental impacts. Yet, the extent to which sustainable intensification can increase yields remains unclear. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the extent to which sustainable intensification can increase yields across South Asia, a region that is expected to face some of the greatest food security challenges over the coming decades. We found that yield gains from sustainable intensification interventions were heterogeneous, and that the average yield gain across all studi es was 21%. Residue retention and the use of organic fertilizers were, in particular, associated with significant and positive yield gains, though the use of organic fertilizers was not always profitable, likely due to large subsidies provided for mineral fertilizers across South Asia. Our work also revealed biases in the current sustainable intensification literature, with research clustered in highly productive, irrigated, and commodity cropping systems, which do not represent large portions of agricultural systems across South Asia. Our results highlight that sustainable intensification interventions should play an important role in increasing food production across South Asia, but yield gains from these interventions are modest compared to estimated yield gaps across the region.",Environmental Research Letters,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8b10' target='_blank'>10.1088/1748-9326/ab8b10</a>,,What is the effectiveness of sustainable intensification for increasing grain yields across South Asia?,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,Evidence Review

We followed the PRISMA methodology: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses. The studied corpus of 91 publications (114 studies) was highly heterogeneous with respect to the methodological approaches used to define or estimate mussel mortality and the related putative risk factors. Results showed that the mortality risk of both mussel species M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis varied across the seasons, increased with an elevated seawater temperature above a thermal threshold of 20 and 24°C, respectively, decreased by protecting mussels from predation, and was associated with the presence of pathogens in M. edulis. For M. galloprovincialis, using mussel spat from the same area where the farming is carried out and farming them together with another mussel species appears to reduce the mortality risk. However, for M. edulis, this could be achieved by using pure crosses and in particular mussel spat having a selected genotype. For wild bed conservation, sand accumulation and anthropogenic sedimentation should be minimised. Our analysis showed that current approaches to this research topic are limited and are unlikely to yield actionable evidence to identify mussel mortality prevention or mitigation strategies. Therefore, recommendations are offered to increase the ability of future eco‐epidemiological research to identify multiple exposures associated with mussel mortality, underpinned by standardised efforts and cooperative initiatives.",Reviews in Aquaculture,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/raq.12484' target='_blank'>10.1111/raq.12484</a>,,What are the relative effects of risk factors on mussel (Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis) mortality?,4,1,3,3,2,3,3,2,1,2,2,3,3,1,2,4,Evidence Review

A small subset of mammal species have the dietary and behavioural flexibility to survive in urban settings. The changes that characterize urban ecology-including landscape transformation, modified diets and shifts in community composition-can either increase or decrease susceptibility and exposure to parasites. We used a meta-analytic approach to systematically assess differences in endoparasitism between mammals in urban and non-urban habitats. Parasite prevalence estimates in matched urban and non-urban mammal populations from 33 species were compiled from 46 published studies, and an overall effect of urban habitation on parasitism was derived after controlling for study and parasite genus. Parasite life cycle type and host order were investigated as moderators of the effect sizes. We found that parasites with complex life cycles were less prevalent in urban carnivore and primate populations than in non-urban populations. However, we found no difference in urban and non-urban prevalence for parasites in rodent and marsupial hosts, or differences in prevalence for parasites with simple life cycles in any host taxa. Our findings therefore suggest the disruption of some parasite transmission cycles in the urban ecological community.",Proceedings.

Such interactions are particularly complex in socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes (SEPLS), where local communities and their environment are highly inter-dependent. We reviewed the scientific literature to determine current views of the positive and negative effects of IAS on local communities in SEPLS, with the goals of better understanding interactions between people and IAS, and devising effective management strategies. Of the 105 IAS investigated in the 57 journal papers we found on the topic, 31 species were reported as being purely undesirable for the local communities, while 30 species were reported as purely desirable, and 44 species were both undesirable and desirable. We found that the instrumental value of IAS often constitutes these desirable effects, and that desirable IAS were likely to invite controversy among stakeholders over its management. A common compromise to address such conflicts was to work with stakeholders for the containment of the IAS, while at the same time to retain or amplify its desirable effects on people to ensure their involvement. In the long-run, however, IAS management in SEPLS cannot be exempted from the need for long-term goals and the strategy leading toward them.

CW units are often preceded by a pre-treatment step, although systems comprising arrangements of CW with different flow types are also applied. The literature review showed that the most commonly treatment system used in rural areas comprised septic tanks followed by CW. Overall, CW rural sanitation systems have shown to consistently remove pollutants, with median removal efficiencies equal to 87% for TSS, 89% for COD, 93% for BOD, 70% for Ntotal and 72% for Ptotal. Removal rates of indicator bacteria of up to 4.0 log10 have also been reported. Recent studies have shown CW to be efficient at removing hormones, pharmaceutical compounds and toxicity of wastewater. Consequently, final effluents are often in compliance with effluent discharge and wastewater reuse regulations. The adoption of pre-treatment reduces CW area requirements and clogging issues, and planted CW present benefits in terms of the removal of pollutants including pathogens. Low implementation and operational costs, simplified operation and maintenance, and high-quality final effluents favour CW. Guidelines provided by the local, competent authorities may support the rural application of CW.

International trade has the potential to increase environmental externalities such as transboundary pollution, deforestation, transportation and production relocation avoiding environmental standards. The share of agricultural goods in total export reached 15% in 2017. Since 2002, the proportion of unprocessed agricultural products have more than doubled, while the volume of processed goods in global trade has tripled. Despite the importance of agricultural trade worldwide, the number of studies exploring the trade-agriculture-environment nexus has so far been limited. This paper aims to provide an overview of the environmental impacts of agricultural trade based on the international economics literature published in recent years by way of a systematic literature review. Results suggest that most recent environmental studies do not view extended trade or trade liberalization in agriculture favourably. Only a limited number of papers state that a country or countries' environment could benefit from agricultural trade, and only a few researdlers have found that agricultural trade did not have any significant influence at all, or have instead found the effects on the environment to be ambiguous.

Conservation actions aimed at restoring or manipulating surface water are employed as a management tool, but empirical evidence on the effectiveness of these approaches is scarce. In this systematic review, we summarized the global experience of manipulating water for amphibian conservation. We explored examples of manipulating water to conserve amphibian species and communities. Approaches varied in their frequency of implementation and in their success. Extending hydroperiod to match larval requirements showed encouraging results, as did off-season drying to control predators. Spraying water into the environment showed several potential applications, but successes were limited. Despite some promising interventions, we identified few (n = 17) empirically supported examples of successful water manipulation to benefit amphibians. It is unclear whether this stems from publication bias or if it is an artifact of language selection. However, manipulating water shows some potential in amphibian conservation, particularly at sites with a proximal water source and in regions where aridity is increasing due to climate change.

Extensive grazing is among the forms of land use that have undergone the greatest changes. This represents one of the main threats to biodiversity; consequently, a comprehensive overview about the impacts on the biodiversity of changes that are happening in pastoral activities is needed. Moreover, a clear picture of the most widely studied geographical areas, habitats, and taxonomic groups needs to be developed in order to understand the situation. In this framework, we carried out a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the publications related to the impacts of pastoral activities on animal biodiversity in Europe. We analysed 223 articles by searching the ISI Web of Science platform and combining keywords related to “pastoral activities” and 'biodiversity indicators”, applying a vote count approach, i.e. simply dividing articles into categories depending on their results (non-significant ones, significant positive results, significant negative ones). Moreover, we conducted a meta-analysis on 33 articles, selecting those focusing on Arthropods (the most studied taxa). To understand the main gaps in this scientific topic, we focused on: i) the identification of the geographical, environmental, and temporal structure of the studies; ii) the description of the main target groups used as bio-indicators; iii) the comparison of different management practices (overgrazing, traditional, agri-environment schemes - AESs), plus land abandonment, to determine which is the best for biodiversity conservation and to evaluate the effectiveness of AESs. There was a bias towards lowlands in comparison to uplands, as well as a lack of long-term studies. Plants were more sensitive than animals to grazing changes. Arthropods’ orders are the taxa used most frequently as indicators, in comparison with vertebrates, especially birds. We identified a generalised negative impact of overgrazing in all the habitats and geographical areas, apparently except in mountainous shrubland. Conversely, land abandonment resulted in a negative influence on biodiversity only in the mountainous areas of southern Europe (underlining the important role of traditional activities), whereas short term abandonment had a beneficial role in central Europe, where overgrazing was more widespread. The meta-analysis suggested that arthropod richness was higher in short to mid-term abandoned pastures than under either extensive or intensive grazing systems. Finally, the effectiveness of AESs for conservation purposes was not confirmed by the vote count approach, whilst meta-analysis detected a positive effect for Arthropods of these same management practices when compared to overgrazing. We highlight a lack of data on AESs, especially when compared with traditional extensive grazing or abandonment. Our findings suggest that AES seems to effectively mimic traditional pastures, contrasting overgrazing, which is one of its main goal. Since AES have a strong potential in influencing sustainable management and promoting biodiversity conservation, the European Union should focus on the most effective and well targeted AES based on research, and further studies will be necessary to continuously assess their effect. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",Journal for Nature Conservation,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2020.125863' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.jnc.2020.125863</a>,Agri-environment schemes; Biodiversity indicator; Invertebrates; Land abandonment; Overgrazing; Systematic-review; Animalia; Arthropoda; Aves; Invertebrata; Vertebrata,What is the impact of pastoral land management on animal species richness and density?,2,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,Evidence Review

A Beta regression was employed considering the percentage of vegetation unbrowsed at the end of the essay as the response variable. A total of 246 essays testing ten different repellents and 236 essays testing four different application methods were extracted from 58 articles. Odor-based repellents, such as those including “meat and blood” and “urine, hair and feces of predators”, were found to be the most effective to reduce damage. Non-lethal methods, such as repellents, could be valuable tools to manage this human-wildlife conflict. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Journal of Environmental Management,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110977' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110977</a>,,How effective are repellents for reducing deer damage?,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,Evidence Review
88703,Are waste hierarchies effective in reducing environmental impacts from food waste? A systematic review for OECD countries,"Redlingshofer, B.; Barles, S.; Weisz, H.",2020,"A key challenge for the sustainability of food systems is the question of how to use food that ends up uneaten. One popular guideline for this purpose in OECD countries has been waste hierarchies, such as the European waste hierarchy and the 3R approach to 'reduce, reuse, recycle, applied to food. Yet despite their popularity, waste hierarchies applied to food are not systematically being implemented. Moreover, a systematic assessment of the effectiveness of the food waste hierarchy in achieving more efficient resource use and reducing environmental impacts is currently not available. We present here a systematic literature review to fill this gap. Our interdisciplinary review has revealed four core insights. First, the waste hierarchy applied to food works well with greenhouse gas emissions but needs adjustments for other environmental impacts. Second, assessments of food waste prevention, although confirmed as the option of highest priority, are under-represented in the reviewed literature. Third, an emerging body of research includes decision criteria for food waste management related to the characteristics of food. Fourth, there are numerous barriers to prioritization of the prevention of food waste. We demonstrate a limited potential of the current 'waste approach to food waste to reduce environmental impacts occurring from food waste. Implications for research, for example concerning the lagging behind in food prevention, provide an opportunity for research and policy to change the focus towards a 'food approach to food waste'.",Resources Conservation and Recycling,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104723' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104723</a>,,What is the effect of waste hierarchies on environmental impacts from food waste?,3,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,Evidence Review

M.; Gallo, E.; Higgins, C. P.; Hogue, T. S.; Luthy, R. G.; Portmann, A. C.; Ulrich, B. A.; Wolfand, J. M.",2020,"Stormwater biofilters are being implemented widely in urban environments to provide green space, alleviate flooding, and improve stormwater quality. However, biofilters with conventional media (sand, soil, and/or mulch or compost) do not reliably remove contaminants from stormwater. Research suggests addition of biochar to the biofilter media can improve the pollutant removal capacity of biofilters. In the current work, we present a systematic review of laboratory and mesocosm studies of biochar-augmented biofilters and an assessment of watershed-scale implementation of biofilters on local water quality. A full text review of 84 papers was conducted; of these, data were extracted from the 14 that met our inclusion criteria. log(10) removal of microbial pollutants and trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) by biochar-augmented media is generally greater than those of the controls containing just sand, soil, and/or compost. log(10) removal of nitrogen, phosphorous, total organic carbon, and total suspended solids in biochar-augmented biofilters is not clearly higher than those of control experiments. A supplemental analysis of four studies reporting longer-term breakthrough data revealed that TOrC removal effectiveness varies substantially among high temperature wood-based biochars, and that operational lifetimes of full-scale systems constrained by TOrC sorption capacity could range from five months to over seven years depending on the selected biochar. At the watershed-scale, biochar-augmented biofilters can provide enhanced treatment of runoff, resulting in the need for fewer treatment units or a smaller volume of watershed runoff treated to meet water quality criteria compared to their conventional counterparts. While their installation can reduce the load of pollutants to receiving waters, achieving concentration-based water quality targets may prove difficult even when pollutant removal capacity is high. This work highlights the importance of a systems approach to studying how biofilter installation affects water quality within a watershed. We identify several topical areas where further research is needed, especially as installation of biofilters and other stormwater control measures gain popularity in highly urbanized watersheds.",Environmental Science-Water Research & Technology,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ew00027b' target='_blank'>10.1039/d0ew00027b</a>,,How effective are biochar-augmented biofilters in comparison with conventional filters for removal of contaminants/pollutants from stormwater?,3,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,1,3,2,2,2,2,Evidence Review

Y.; Villemey, A.; Vanpeene, S.; Coulon, A.; Azambourg, V.; Hulard, M.; Guinard, E.; Bertheau, Y.; De Lachapelle, F. F.; Rauel, V.; Le Mitouard, E.; Jeusset, A.; Vargac, M.; Witte, I.; Jactel, H.; Touroult, J.; Reyjol, Y.; Sordello, R.",2020,"Background: Linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, powerlines and waterways) generate well documented fragmenting effects on species habitats. However, the potential of verges of linear transportation infrastructures (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of constant loss of natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for compensating the loss of biodiversity they generated have to be considered. This paper is the first synthesis of evidence addressing this topic for vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles) in temperate ecosystems. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature survey using two online publication databases, three search engines, specialist websites, and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. We successively screened the articles for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize the retained studies and to critically appraise them. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for vertebrates, and the effects of landscape and management on these potentialities. We critically appraised all studies to assess their risk of bias and created a database of the studies with low and medium risk of bias. We synthesized results for each specific question in narrative syntheses. Finally, studies that met meta-analysis requirements were used for quantitative syntheses. Results: Our initial searches identified 83,565 documents. After critical appraisal, we retained 119 documents that reported 128 studies. Most studies were conducted in Europe (49%) and in the United States of America (22%), and were about mammals (61%) and birds (20%). Results from the narrative synthesis and meta-analyses converged and revealed that the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges to constitute a habitat for vertebrate species varies according to the infrastructure and the biological group considered. Especially, highway verges may be a refuge for small mammals but seems detrimental to birds. The potential also varied depending on the landscape considered, with urbanisation being related to lower biodiversity hosted by verges. We found a wide variety of verge management practices with few studies on each practice, which prevented us from drawing general conclusions. Likewise, we found too few studies assessing the corridor potential of verges to be able to fully conclude although this potential seems to exist. We did not find any study assessing the effect of landscape context or management on the role of corridor of verges. Conclusions: We identified a major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for vertebrates, and when they exist studies rarely directly measured movements on verges. We thus encourage more research on this topic and the development of protocols that enable direct measures of vertebrate movements. The effect of management practices on the role of habitat of verges also deserves further investigations, and research efforts should be coordinated to focus on one specific practice (e.g. vegetation management).",Environmental Evidence,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-020-00196-7' target='_blank'>10.1186/s13750-020-00196-7</a>,,What are the effects of linear transportation infrastructure verges and associated management practices and human-induced disturbances on vertebrates (except fishes) in the temperate climatic zone?,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,4,Evidence Review

A systematic and mechanistic understanding of EA responses to HM contamination in soil is necessary for predicting the consequences for nutrient availability and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S). In this study, a meta-analysis based on 671 observations found the activities of seven enzymes to decrease in response to soil contamination with Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu and As. HM contamination linearly reduced the activities of all enzymes in the following order: arylsulfatase > dehydrogenase > β-glucosidase > urease > acid phosphatase > alkaline phosphatase > catalase. The activities of two endoenzymes: arylsulfatase (partly as exoenzyme) and dehydrogenase were reduced by 72% and 64%, respectively. These reductions were two times greater than of exoenzymes: β-glucosidase, urease, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and catalase (partly endoenzyme). This reflects the much stronger impact of HMs on living microorganisms and their endoenzymes than on extracellular enzymes stabilized on clay minerals and organic matter. Increasing clay content weakened the negative effects of HM contamination on EAs. All negative effects of HMs on EAs decreased with soil depth because HMs remain mainly in the topsoil. EAs involved in the cycling of C and S were more affected by HMs than the enzymes associated with the cycling of N and P. Consequently, HM contamination may alter the stoichiometry of C, N, P and S released by enzymatic decomposition of organic compounds that consequently affect microbial community structure and activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139744' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139744</a>,,"What are the effects of soil heavy metal contamination on enzyme activities involved in carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur cycles?",3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,1,1,3,3,2,1,Evidence Review

However, the effects of minimum tillage, coupled with crop residue retention (including no–tillage plus residue retention, NTR, and reduced tillage plus residue retention, RTR), on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock have not been systematically analyzed. Using a dataset consisting of 1928 pairs of data points from 243 studies, we conducted a global meta–analysis to evaluate the effects of crop residue retention and minimum tillage on SOC stock in the 0–30 cm soil and how these effects varied with soil (soil sampling depth and texture), environmental (climate) and crop management conditions (cropping intensity), as well as treatment duration. We found that regardless of the climatic condition, crop management, or residue retention, minimum tillage alone increased the overall mean SOC stock. Specifically, NT and RT increased SOC stock by 11 and 6%, respectively, in comparison to conventional tillage (CT). Compared with CT, NTR and RTR increased SOC stock by 13 and 12%, respectively. The above effects were greater in the topsoil (62% of data points from the 0–15 cm depth) than in the subsoil (38% of data points from the 15–30 cm depth). Moreover, residue retention enhanced the resistance of SOC turnover to agricultural and environmental factors; mean annual temperature (coefficient = 0.15), soil pH (0.14), and experimental duration (0.08) were critical for increasing SOC stock with minimum tillage alone, while the response ratio of SOC stock under coupled residue retention and minimum tillage was insensitive to changes in those factors. Additionally, double cropping generally increased SOC stock cross all conservation tillage practices compared to multiple cropping. Therefore, we conclude that minimum tillage coupled with residue retention in a double-cropping system is the most promising management system for increasing SOC stocks in the 0–30 cm soil in croplands Our finding can inform sustainable soil management practices aimed at increasing resistance of SOC in croplands to climate change and soils degradation induced by intensive agriculture. © 2020",Science of the Total Environment,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140147' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140147</a>,,What is the effect of crop residue retention on soil carbon accumulation in minimum tillage systems?,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,2,Evidence Review

Ground-based shooting is widely used in management programs aiming to alleviate the impacts of invasive or overabundant wildlife populations. However, evaluations of individual shooting operations have shown variable results, and the effectiveness of ground-shooting as a population-management intervention has not been systematically examined. Aims. Our review aimed to (1) assess the efficacy of shooting as a population management tool, and (2) identify commonalities among studies that will help managers identify situations where ground-shooting is most likely to be effective. Methods. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify studies involving ground-shooting. From each study, we collated information about operational objectives, target taxa, geographic context, type of shooter used, effort, effectiveness, and use of additional control tools. Key results. Most studies had no a priori quantifiable objectives. However, 60% of the 64 case studies produced a detectable reduction in population density and/or damage. The most common type of operation used unpaid or commercial harvest-oriented shooters to reduce herbivore density or damage. Only 30% of the operations that used volunteer shooters or recreational hunters achieved their objectives. Target taxa, geographic area or integration of shooting with other population-control methods had no detectable effect on the effectiveness of shooting operations. Common factors that hindered the effectiveness of shooting operations included immigration of target species from adjacent areas (n = 13), decreasing effort from shooters as the target population declined (n = 7) and selective harvesting (n = 7). Conclusions. Ground-based shooting can be an effective management tool for overabundant wildlife populations, but many shooting operations did not achieve a notable decrease in animal abundance or damage. The source of failure could often be attributed to an inability to remove a sufficient proportion of the population to cause a population decline. Implications. Managers contemplating using ground-based shooting to reduce the impacts or density of wildlife populations should (1) carefully consider whether this is a suitable management tool to achieve the desired outcomes, (2) establish clear objectives that aim to meet defined outcomes and allow for continuous improvement, and (3) ensure that operations are sufficiently resourced to achieve and maintain those objectives.",Wildlife Research,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1071/wr19129' target='_blank'>10.1071/wr19129</a>,,What is the effectiveness of ground-based shooting to control overabundant terrestrial mammal populations?,2,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,Evidence Review

A meta-analysis of field plot data,"Chen, J.; Xiao, H.; Li, Z.; Liu, C.; Ning, K.; Tang, C.",2020,"Anthropogenic pressure coupled with high rainfall and diverse heterogeneous landscapes (e.g., land use and topography) has resulted in severe water erosion in the red soil hilly region (RSHR) of China. Soil and water conservation measures (SWCMs) have been extensively implemented, and their effects on runoff and sediment control have been widely tested at plot scales. However, it is difficult to gain an overview of the efficiency of SWCMs due to the difficulty of directly upscaling field observations to regional scales. We conducted a meta-analysis of 498 field plots covering 53 sites in the RSHR to evaluate the efficiency of different SWCMs and identify optimal conservation practices. The results were as follows: (i) SWCMs involving erosion control (92%) had a greater efficiency than those focusing on runoff reduction (73%). (ii) The implementation of combined measures was more effective than single measures for reducing runoff and soil loss. (iii) All thirty SWCMs showed a significant effect with respect to runoff and sediment control, except for contour tillage effect on reduction of soil loss. (iv) The maximum and minimum ratios between runoff and sediment reduction were found in orchard and cropland, respectively. (v) Six measures, mulching, tree crop + grass, tree crop + hedgerows, tree crop + grass cover + terrace, tree crop + hedgerows + terrace and hedgerows + contour tillage, can be recommended as high effective SWCMs in the RSHR.

The objective of this systematic review was to calculate the over-yielding of silvopastures compared to open pastures and forests, timber plantations, or orchards managed separately. A literature search was completed for comparisons of the productivity of these practices in temperate regions. Data collected from these studies included mean yields of timber or non-timber forest products, forages, and livestock, as well as the characteristics of the study site. Silvopasture practices improve the productivity of land typically managed separately for pasture or trees by 42-55%, depending on whether the productivity of the pastures is measured by livestock or forage output, respectively. In most cases, over-yielding occurred despite a reduction in individual forage, livestock, or tree productivity in the silvopastures. Calculating confidence intervals around these means was not feasible because standard errors were largely not reported or available. Some assumptions were made about the actual productivity of timber or non-timber forest products.

The role played by the environment in disseminating resistance is increasingly considered, as well as its capacity for mitigation. We reviewed the literature on strategies to control dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and mobile genetic elements (MGE) in the environment. Methods This systematic review focused on three main strategies: (i) restriction of antibiotic use (S1), (ii) treatments of liquid/solid matrices (S2) and (iii) management of natural environment (S3). Articles were collected from seven scientific databases until July 2017 and from Web of Science until June 2018. Only studies reporting measurements of ARB, ARG or MGE in environmental samples were included. An evidence map was drawn from metadata extracted from all studies eligible for S1, S2 and S3. Subsets of studies were assessed for internal and external validity to perform narrative and quantitative syntheses. A meta-analysis was carried out to assess the effects of organic waste treatments (random-effect models). Review findings Nine hundred and thirty-one articles representing 1316 individual studies (n) were eligible for S1 (n = 59), S2 (n = 781) and S3 (n = 476) strategies, respectively. Effects of interventions to control the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the environment were primarily studied in strategy S2. A partial efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to reduce antibiotic resistance in treated effluent was reported in 118 high validity studies. In spite of the heterogeneity in published results, the meta-analysis showed that composting and drying were efficient treatments to reduce the relative abundance of ARG and MGE in organic waste, by 84% [65%; 93%] and 98% [80%; 100%], respectively. The effect of anaerobic digestion was not statistically significant (51% reduction [- 2%; 77%]) when organic waste treatments were compared together in the same model. Studies in strategies S1 and S3 mainly assessed the effects of exposure to sources of contamination. For instance, 28 medium/high validity studies showed an increase of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments at the WWTP discharge point. Some of these studies also showed a decrease of resistance as the distance from the WWTP increases, related to a natural resilience capacity of aquatic environments. Concerning wildlife, nine medium/high validity studies showed that animals exposed to anthropogenic activities carried more ARB.",Environmental Evidence,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-020-0187-x' target='_blank'>10.1186/s13750-020-0187-x</a>,,How effective are different strategies to control dissemination of antibiotic resistance ?,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,Evidence Review

In particular, low-quality litter in mixtures shows a significant synergistic effect, while additive effects are observed for high-quality species. Additionally, synergistic effects turn into antagonistic effects when soil fauna are absent or litter is in very late stages of decomposition (near-humus). In contrast to temperate and tropical areas, studies in boreal regions show significant antagonistic effects. Our two meta-analyses provide a systematic evaluation of nonadditive effects in mixed litter decomposition studies and show that litter quality alters the effects of litter mixing. Our results indicate that nutrient transfer, soil fauna and inhibitory secondary compounds can influence mixing effects.

This is posing concerns about their environmental impact and it is fostering research on biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services in this agroecosystem. With this systematic review, we aim at providing a global and comprehensive overview of the current research on biodiversity and biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services in vineyards, considering the effects of landscape features and management practices. We carried out a systematic literature search on the Web of Science Core Collection database. Literature was filtered according to several criteria, resrdting in a final collection of 218 papers published between 1995 and 2018 and referring to different organism groups (from microbes to vertebrates) and two spatial scales (local and landscape). The results of the studies are often contrasting and lzuwn- and scale-dependent, thus hindering conclusions at the global scale. However, at least three main points of practical relevance can be fixed: (i) organic viticulture weakly enhances biodiversity at the landscape scale, whereas contrasting effects have been found al the local scale; (ii) ground vegetation management by cover cropping and the conservation of native ground cover strongly promotes biodiversity; (iii) habitat heterogeneity al the landscape and local scales is a key element for biodiversity. Several studies support the view that promoting biodiversity in vineyard-dominated landscapes could also positively impact on several ecosystem services. Our study further revealed knowledge gaps that should be filled by future research. In particular, important geographical areas for wine production, as well as several organism groups, have been completely neglected. Studies at the landscape level are still scarce (specifically those addressing landscape configuration), and also the research about supporting, provisioning, and cultural biodiversity-mediatecl ecosystem services is still in its infancy.

88565,A review and meta-analysis of the agricultural potential of struvite as a phosphorus fertilizer,"Hertzberger, A.J.; Cusick, R.D.; Margenot, A.J.",2020,"The low water solubility of struvite is thought to limit its agronomic utility as a phosphorus (P) fertilizer compared with highly soluble P fertilizers. Furthermore, struvite's fertilizer potential is complicated by its hypothesized soil pH-dependent solubility, crop-specific interactions, and limited availability of struvite-derived N, which may explain conflicting reports of crop responses to struvite compared with conventional P fertilizers. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of soil pH, soil test P (STP), P rate, struvite particle size, and struvite-derived N on crop aboveground biomass, P concentration, P uptake, and N uptake. Struvite-fertilized plants yielded higher biomass, P concentration, and P uptake compared with ammonium phosphates, and superphosphates in soils with pH &lt; 6 and crop responses decreased with increasing pH. Crop responses to struvite were inversely related to experiment duration to soil mass ratios (d kg−1) used in greenhouse studies, opposite to the hypothesized benefit of more roots per unit soil on struvite dissolution. The proportion of total N applied derived from struvite increased with increasing struvite-P application rate and was inversely related to total N uptake, likely due to the increased crop reliance on slowly available struvite-N.

88553,Systematic review: Effect of irrigation water quality and deficit irrigation on crop yield and water use efficiency.,"Tura, L. E.; Tolossa, T. T.",2020,"The main purpose of this paper is to review on the effect of irrigation water quality and deficit irrigation on crop yield and water use efficiency. Low quality water for irrigation can impose a major environmental constraint to crop productivity. If salts become excessive, losses in yield will result. To prevent yield loss, salts in the soil must be controlled at a concentration below that which might affect yield. Irrigation application below the full evapotranspiration requirement is termed as deficit irrigation. Deficit irrigation consists of deliberately applying irrigation water in amounts below the plant's water requirements. Deficit irrigation can be applied at certain periods during the crop's growing season or throughout its growing season. Yield reductions also occur in a number of crops when subjected to water stress. Yield reductions depend on the crop's sensitivity to water stress at its various growth stages. In order for deficit irrigation to be an economically viable practice, the revenue lost due to yield reduction should be lower than savings in total cost of production. The goal of deficit irrigation is to increase crop water use efficiency by reducing the amount of water that is applied or by reducing the number of irrigation events. The interaction effects of water quality and DI illustrated that when the two types of stresses; saline and DI were coupled together, a serious reduction occurred on total dry biomass and total yield.

We reviewed 1252 published research articles and extracted or calculated effect sizes for 12 drivers from 82 independent studies within 26 articles that met our inclusion criteria. We used a fixed-effect model to calculate the absolute value of the mean effect size of each driver by age class studied and pooled across age classes to estimate effects on the overall abundance of red snapper. Habitat complexity and intra-specific competition had large effects on overall abundance and juvenile abundance, while habitat type and protection from predators showed medium to large effects on age 0 recruits and juvenile red snapper, and the mean effect of all drivers studied for adult red snapper were small or had no effect on abundance. Our results provide systematic support for the role of density-dependent mechanisms (habitat quality and availability, competition, predation) in shaping the regional abundance of red snapper, particularly during the juvenile stages. Sensitivity analyses indicated that issues with non-independence (e.g. within-article correlation), between-study heterogeneity, and publication bias influenced the magnitude and certainty of effect size estimates in a subset of drivers. Thus, our meta-analytical review also highlights the need for more empirical research on certain drivers (e.g. temperature, hypoxia) to improve our understanding of the factors that shape the regional abundance of red snapper.",Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-020-09608-w' target='_blank'>10.1007/s11160-020-09608-w</a>,,What are the effects of environmental and ecological drivers on the abundance of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico?,2,1,3,3,2,1,4,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,3,Evidence Review

Increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 are also showing a negative impact on staple food crops, such as rice. In addition to added heat stresses decreasing growth and productivity of rice crops, micronutrient concentration, specifically iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), shows a significant decline when grown in elevated atmospheric CO2. This is likely to most significantly impact those who are already impoverished and living in a state of chronic food insecurity, thus further contributing to micronutrient deficiency diseases, also known as hidden hunger. A systematic review of the literature regarding micronutrient concentration, specifically Fe and Zn, in rice grains grown under elevated CO2 was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Eight of the studies found met the required guidelines and were included in this review. While early studies were contradictory, later studies show a clear correlation between elevated atmospheric CO2 and decreased Fe and Zn concentrations.

L.; Haines, A.; Dangour, A. D.; Scheelbeek, P. F. D.",2020,"Background: Environmental changes are predicted to threaten human health, agricultural production and food security. Whilst their impact has been evaluated for major cereals, legumes and vegetables, no systematic evidence synthesis has been performed to date evaluating impact of environmental change on fruits, nuts and seeds (FN&S) - valuable sources of nutrients and pivotal in reducing risks of non-communicable disease. Methods: We systematically searched seven databases, identifying available published literature (1970-2018) evaluating impacts of water availability and salinity, temperature, carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) on yields and nutritional quality of FN&S. Dose-response relationships were assessed and, where possible, mean yield changes relative to baseline conditions were calculated. Results: 81 papers on fruits and 24 papers on nuts and seeds were identified, detailing 582 and 167 experiments respectively. A 50% reduction in water availability and a 3-4dS m-1 increase in water salinity resulted in significant fruit yield reductions (mean yield changes: -20.7% [95%CI -43.1% to -1.7%]; and -28.2% [95%CI -53.0% to -3.4%] respectively). A 75%-100% increase in CO2 concentrations resulted in positive yield impacts (+37.8%; [95%CI 4.1% to 71.5%]; and 10.1%; [95%CI -30.0% to 50.3%] for fruits and nuts respectively). Evidence on yield impacts of increased O3 concentrations and elevated temperatures (>25 °C) was scarce, but consistently negative. The positive effect of elevated CO2 levels appeared to attenuate with simultaneous exposure to elevated temperatures. Data on impacts of environmental change on nutritional quality of FN&S were sparse, with mixed results. Discussion: In the absence of adaptation strategies, predicted environmental changes will reduce yields of FN&S. With global intake already well-below WHO recommendations, declining FN&S yields may adversely affect population health. Adaptation strategies and careful agricultural and food system planning will be essential to optimise crop productivity in the context of future environmental changes, thereby supporting and safeguarding sustainable and resilient food systems. © 2020 The Author(s).

Soil tillage practices can conserve water and increase yield effectively, but the regional applicability of soil tillage practices has not been systematically studied so far. It is significant to study the regional characteristics of tillage practices on water-conserving and yield-increasing so that the optimal practices for improving the crop water production and maintaining the agricultural sustainable development can be determined. This study applied the meta-analysis method to analyze results extracted from 156 peer-reviewed published papers conducted at 62 agricultural experimental sites for evaluating the effects of commonly used tillage practices, i.e., No-tillage (NT), Subsoiling (SS), Mulching (M), Ridge and Furrow Planting without Mulching (F), and Ridge and Furrow Planting with Mulching (F-M) on crop yield, water consumption and water use efficiency (WUE) of wheat and maize in Northern China. The results showed that NT only increased yield of winter wheat in North-central China and spring maize in Northeast China. SS increased wheat and maize yield by 16.3±3.2% and 9.2±3.0%, and increased water consumption by 8.4±3.4% and 1.8±1.8%, respectively. M increased the yield of wheat and maize by 14.9±2.9% and 17.7±6.2%, respectively, while it did not increase the water consumption. F increased the yield of wheat by 5.0±1.1%. F-M increased wheat and maize yield by 18.9±6.3% and 36.6±11.8%, respectively. This study recommends that, SS is suitable for winter wheat and summer maize in North-central China.

Here we conducted a meta-analysis of the RF effects on maize yield, ET and WUE based on the data collected from peer-reviewed literature. Yield, ET and WUE varied with climate, soil and mulching management. Averaged across all the geographic locations, RF increased the yield and WUE of maize by 47 % and 39 %, respectively, but no effects on ET. An increase in the yield and WUE occurred under RF in regions regardless of the mean growing season air temperature (MT) or a mean precipitation during the growing season (MP), although there was a trend that RF is more beneficial under low MP. RF also decreased ET in regions with MT>12 °C. RF increased the yield and WUE in regions with medium or fine soil texture. RF increased the yield, ET, and WUE in regions with low soil bulk density (BD) (≤1.3 g cm−3). But in areas where BD is larger than 1.3 g cm−3, RF only increased the yield and WUE. RF increased the yield and WUE with or without mulching, but decreased ET when no mulching was used. Together, optimizing RF effects on the yield, ET and WUE in maize was largely dependent on environmental conditions and management practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Agricultural Water Management,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106144' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106144</a>,,What is the effect of ridge and furrow cultivation on maize/corn yield and water use efficiency in China?,3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,2,1,Evidence Review

S.; Li, Y.; Brown, P.; Xu, C.",2020,"Root-knot nematodes are the most damaging nematode pest for worldwide agricultural production. Chemical control is the most popular method; however, the risks of chemical nematicides to environment and health have made some effective nematicides being removed from the use for some crops. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted to identify the most potential and consistent alternative strategies. Biological control has been a popular option with various, bacteria, fungi and other predators (e.g. mites). Among all the natural enemies of nematodes, nematophagous fungi are the most diverse and they use a variety of mechanisms to capture and kill nematodes. Many studies of nematophagous fungi have been published, but no cohesive analysis of these studies has been attempted. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to identify biocontrol fungi with the most consistent effects against root-knot nematodes. Pochonia spp., Trichoderma spp. and Paecilomyces spp. were the most studied fungal genera against root-knot nematodes. In general, most of the fungal genera controlled root-knot nematodes and improved plant growth and yield. However, the results showed that fungi alone cannot achieve a high level of suppression. In general, fungal bio-agents could reduce root-knot nematode population and damage levels by 45% compared to untreated conditions. Arthrobotrys spp. and Acremonium spp. were found to be comparatively more effective in root-knot nematode damage reduction than other species.

We systematically assessed 63 published studies during 2000-2015, including 2050 observations at 68 sites on the Loess Plateau with the aim of determining soil moisture changes and the factors influencing those changes. We found that, after land use conversion, soil moisture decreased by 17% in the upper 100 cm soil layer and that tree plantations and shrub lands appeared to cause soil moisture depletion which became increasingly serious with soil depth. The decrease of soil moisture was significantly influenced by the planting species in all restoration types (tree plantations, shrub lands, and grasslands). We also found that tree plantations and grasslands converted from farmlands consumed more soil moisture than from wasteland (including bare land, abandoned land and wild grasslands). Artificial restoration led to significant soil moisture reduction, but natural restoration had little effect on soil moisture. Therefore, natural restoration should be an alternative restoration practice on the Loess Plateau.

Using a systematic meta-analysis approach, this review aims at examining China's approach to CT and to characterize the main outcomes of long-term CT research across northern China. Data from organizations in charge of CT research in China showed an improvement in crop yield of at least 4% under double cropping systems and 6% under single cropping systems in dry areas of northern China. Furthermore, long-term CT practices were reported to have improved soil physical properties (soil structure, bulk density, pore size, and aggregate stability), soil nutrient levels, and reduction in greenhouse gas emission. Other benefits include significant increase in income levels and protection of the environment. Limitations to CT practice highlighted in this study include occasional reduction in crop yields during initial years of cropping, significant reduction in total N of soils, increase in N2O emission, and the need for customized machinery for its implementation.

It is an inorganic material that can be synthesized in the presence of a precursor rich in aluminosilica and an activator. This novel material also resembles the structure of a zeolite which makes it suitable in wastewater treatment applications. Meanwhile, one of the contributors to toxic metals in wastewater is the mining industry. The presence of these toxic metals in wastewater due to environmental impact brought by mining activities can contaminate both the ground and surface water. In addition, this could also cause environmental damage affecting the biodiversity around the area. One of the many challenges that the mining industry faces that contributes to environmental pollution is the generation of acid mine drainage. This is produced through further exposure of sulfide ore and other minerals to water and oxygen. On the other hand, the permeable reactive barrier is an emerging remediation technique that can be used to treat acid mine drainage. This paper reviews the current trend on geopolymer and permeable reactive barrier for acid mine drainage treatment research.

In order to do this research, international search engines were employed to systematically search peer-reviewed articles, including the cooling effect of blue-green space and threshold-size-based UHI mitigation studies. After that, the inductive analysis is used to analyze the relevant literature. We found that previous studies concentrated on the correlations between different landscape types, temperature variations and the quantification of cooling intensity, etc. However, threshold-size-based research has received less attention, which limits the ability to make specific recommendations for actionable planning and management – usingthe smallest blue-green space for the best cooling effect. The review also revealed the controversies over the effects of blue-green space size, shape, landscape composition and configuration on cooling effect. Besides, we pointed out that the uncertainties (i.e., the optimal proportion of blue-green space in a park) and the reasons of controversial results of the cooling effect need to be further investigated. We also suggested that more attention should be paid to quantify the contributions of local background climate and landscape characteristics to the cooling effect (threshold-size) of blue-green space.

We performed a meta-analysis of the responses of insect species with different life history traits to anthropogenic edges, focusing on the species' behavioral characteristics and whether they are considered invasive or not. We systematically searched the Web of Science database for papers on this subject published until May 2018. We examined response ratios for 712 comparisons of anthropogenic edge effects on insects. As expected, the responses differed according to the traits evaluated. Soil-foraging and social insects were negatively affected by anthropogenic edges.

Simulated nitrogen (N) deposition is important to agriculture and has considerable impacts on plant phenolic metabolism but a systematic understanding of such effects is lacking. We here synthesized results from 123 articles and evaluated the responses of plant biomass, in vivo N status, soluble sugar concentrations, carbon (C)/N ratios and multiple phenolic compounds to the simulated N deposition. This meta-analysis showed that the simulated N deposition significantly increased plant biomass and N content but reduced the concentrations of phenolic compounds in a dose-depended manner. This was linked to the suppression of phenolic generating phenylalanine ammonia_lyase activity and key associated gene expression by the simulated N deposition. Total phenolic concentrations were negatively related to biomass but were positively correlated with C/N and soluble sugar contents. Overall, our results indicated adverse effects of simulated N deposition on phenolic metabolism which could compromise key aspects of crop quality and are apparently hidden by positive effects on plant biomass.

P.; Fleming, A.; Marais, Z.; Mendham, D.",2020,"Intensification of the dairy industry globally, combined with a changing climate, has placed increased pressure on natural capital assets (and the flow of ecosystem services) on farms. Agroforestry is widely promoted as an intervention to address these issues. While some benefits of integrating trees on farms, such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity, are reasonably well known, less is known about other potential benefits, such as on-farm production. Understanding and quantifying these benefits would inform farm planning and decision-making. We used a systematic review approach to analyse the evidence base for biophysical ecosystem services from woody systems (including shelterbelts, riparian plantings, plantations, pasture trees, silvopasture and remnant native vegetation) provided to grazed dairy enterprises. We identified 83 publications containing 123 records that fit our review criteria of reporting on biophysical ecosystem services from woody systems on dairy farms relative to a grazed pasture comparison. For each relationship between a woody system and ecosystem service, we assessed the level of support, strength and predominant direction of evidence, and summarised the causal relationships (woody system >> mechanism >> outcome). Shelterbelts and riparian plantings were the most commonly reported woody systems. Linkages between woody systems and ecosystem services were largely positive, with the types of services provided and their importance differing among systems. Mean evaluation scores for the strength of the evidence were moderate to strong. However, the number of records for each relationship was often low. Consequently, only eight of the 30 causal pathways identified had high confidence; a further 14 had medium confidence indicating that these have good potential to deliver benefits but warrant further work.

88480,Sea lice removal by cleaner fish in salmon aquaculture: a review of the evidence base,"Overton, K.; Barrett, L. T.; Oppedal, F.; Kristiansen, T. S.; Dempster, T.",2020,"Stocking cleaner fish to control sea lice infestations in Atlantic salmon farms is widespread and is viewed as a salmon welfare-friendly alternative to current delousing control treatments. The escalating demand for cleaner fish (similar to 60 million stocked worldwide per year), coupled with evidence that they experience poor welfare and high mortality in sea cages, requires that the lice removal effect of cleaner fish be substantiated by robust evidence. Here, we systematically analysed (1) studies that tested the delousing efficacy of cleaner fish species in tanks or sea cages and (2) studies of spatial overlap - and therefore likely encounter rate - between cleaner fish and salmon when stocked together in sea cages. Only 11 studies compared lice removal between tanks or cages with and without cleaner fish using a replicated experimental design. Most studies had insufficient replication (1 or 2 replicates) and were conducted in small-scale tanks or cages, which does not reflect the large volume and deep cages in which they are deployed commercially. Reported efficacies varied across species and experimental scale: from a 28% increase to a 100% reduction in lice numbers when cleaner fish were used. Further, our review revealed that the interaction of cleaner fish and salmon in sea cages has rarely been documented. While much of the evidence is promising, there is a mismatch between the current evidence and the extent of use by the industry. We recommend replicated studies in 9 key areas at a full commercial scale across all species that are currently widely used. More targeted, evidence-based use of cleaner fish should increase their efficacy and help to alleviate economic, environmental, and ethical concerns.",Aquaculture Environment Interactions,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3354/aei00345' target='_blank'>10.3354/aei00345</a>,,How effective are cleaner fish for removing sea lice from tanks and cages used in salmon aquaculture?,3,1,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,Evidence Review

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the adsorption capability of dyes on carbon-based adsorbent materials (CBAMs) has been compiled. Further, the effects of process variables i.e., pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and initial concentration), adsorption kinetics, and isotherms were investigated while considering the classification of different groups of dyes and adsorbents. The Metafor package provides functions for conducting meta-analyses in R software. Electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were systematically searched based on Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) from January 1, 2009 to May 1, 2018. The following parameters were evaluated according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After detailed screening and analysis, 835 articles were eligible for the review section. Among them, 87 studies met all quantitative criteria for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model with a high heterogeneity (I2 = 99.99%). According to the evidence, basic dyes with n = 661 (∼50%) and powder activated carbon (PAC) sorbent with n = 752 (∼57%) have received the most attention among researchers. The results revealed that the mean of removal efficiency-based dyes classification was between 79.9 and 93.7% and the adsorption capacity was lied within the range of 76.8–303.6 mg/g. Meanwhile, the maximum adsorption capacity belongs to graphene families with Qm &gt; 320 mg/g, while the minimum Qm was related to G and GAC with capacities of 108.5 and 110.7 mg/g, respectively. Pseudo-second-order kinetic model with 88.7% and Langmuir isotherm with 74% had the best fitting with the data studied. Baujat plot revealed that two studies (ID: 75 and 12) had the minimum influence on adsorption capacity with the highest dffits and cook's distance.

G.",2020,"Knowledge of how disturbances such as fire shape habitat structure and composition, and affect animal interactions, is fundamental to ecology and ecosystem management. Predators also exert strong effects on ecological communities, through top-down regulation of prey and competitors, which can result in trophic cascades. Despite their ubiquity, ecological importance and potential to interact with fire, our general understanding of how predators respond to fire remains poor, hampering ecosystem management. To address this important knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of fire on terrestrial, vertebrate predators world-wide. We found 160 studies spanning 1978-2018. There were 36 studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis, from which we extracted 96 effect sizes (Hedges' g) for 67 predator species relating to changes in abundance indices, occupancy or resource selection in burned and unburned areas, or before and after fire. Studies spanned geographic locations, taxonomic families and study designs, but most were located in North America and Oceania (59% and 24%, respectively), and largely focussed on felids (24%) and canids (25%). Half (50%) of the studies reported responses to wildfire, and nearly one third concerned prescribed (management) fires. There were no clear, general responses of predators to fire, nor relationships with geographic area, biome or life-history traits (e.g. body mass, hunting strategy and diet). Responses varied considerably between species. Analysis of species for which at least three effect sizes had been reported in the literature revealed that red foxes Vulpes vulpes mostly responded positively to fire (e.g. higher abundance in burned compared to unburned areas) and eastern racers Coluber constrictor negatively, with variances overlapping zero only slightly for both species. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed strong variation in predator responses to fire, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. Varied responses of predator species to fire likely depend on ecosystem context. Consistent reporting of ongoing monitoring and management experiments is required to improve understanding of the mechanisms driving predator responses to fire, and any broader effects (e.g. trophic interactions). The divergent responses of species in our study suggest that adaptive, context-specific management of predator-fire relationships is required.",Journal of Animal Ecology,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13153' target='_blank'>10.1111/1365-2656.13153</a>,,"What are the effects of wild and prescribed fire on abundance, occupancy and resource selection of carnivorous terrestrial vertebrates?",3,1,3,3,2,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review

S.",2020,"The advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), as an alternative technology to eliminate pesticides from aqueous environments, consist of several groups of technologies that have been used with high efficiency in the treatment of water and wastewater in recent decades. A systematic review of the scientific literature to evaluate the most common advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the removal of organophosphorus pesticides in aqueous matrices is addressed in this study. Meta-analysis is also performed to provide a precise and robust summary estimate after a systematic and rigorous integration of the available evidence. In the current study, 9 sub-groups of AOPs were reviewed, such as electrochemical, UV/H2O2 photolysis, photocatalysis, Fenton-type, plasma, gamma irradiation, sulfate-based catalyst, sonolysis and ozonation technology for organophosphorus pesticides degradation. The random effects model was used to estimate the pooled measurements and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). In total, six studies were included in this review. All studies, except one, used the photocatalytic process as AOP. The average pooled percentage of AOP for pesticide degradation was 66.8 (95 % CI: 58.1-75.6). In addition, the most studied pesticides are chlorpyrifos and diazinon which, according to the results of the meta-analysis, the photocatalytic process has the highest efficiency of diazinon elimination with an average percentage of 79.2 (95 % CI: 76.8-81.5).

Research into the impacts of thinning on surface water, soil, and vegetation re-growth have occurred concurrently with the growing popularity of forest thinning; however, its potential impact on groundwater recharge and related springs ecosystems has largely been ignored until recently. This systematic review provides an overview of some of the tools used to measure the influence of forest management on groundwater recharge, including numerical and process based modeling, empirical paired-watershed approaches, and statistical stochastic techniques. A brief discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of each method also is provided. The paper provides a literature review of existing studies of groundwater recharge and forest management from 1971 to 2018. The review of 35 studies indicates a range of results and highlights differences between studies of clear-cut forests versus thinned forests. Forests that were thinned had a greater amount of groundwater recharge than clear-cut forests, indicating that recharge responds positively and more strongly to reduced sublimation and evaporation in partially thinned forests than to clear-cut removal of mature trees. A similar test with forest encroachment studies revealed no differences between forest encroachment and either thinning regime. The number of forest management-groundwater recharge studies has dramatically increased over the last two decades, indicating increased interest in finding tools to increase groundwater yields for societal use in rapidly populating aridland forests. To our knowledge there have been no studies of forest thinning impacts on springs ecosystems, a field of study rich with possibilities for ecologists, hydrologists, rangeland and forestry scientists, and interdisciplinary ecohydrology practitioners. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Ecological Engineering,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105701' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105701</a>,,"What are the effects of clear cut, forest thinning, and re-forestation on groundwater recharge and yield in aridland forests?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,Evidence Review
88455,Impacts of nitrogen deposition on terrestrial plant diversity: A meta-analysis in China,"Han, W.-J.; Cao, J.-Y.; Liu, J.-L.; Jiang, J.; Ni, J.",2019,"Aims: With the global atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition increasing, the effect of N deposition on terrestrial plant diversity has been widely studied. Some studies have reviewed the effects of N deposition on plant species diversity; however, all studies addressed the effects of N deposition on plant community focused on species richness in specific ecosystem. There is a need for a systematic meta-analysis covering multiple dimensions of plant diversity in multiple climate zones and ecosystems types. Our goal was to quantify changes in species richness, evenness and uncertainty in plant communities in response to N addition across different environmental and experimental contexts. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of 623 experimental records published in English and Chinese journals to evaluate the response of terrestrial plant diversity to the experimental N addition in China. Three metrics were used to quantify the change in plant diversity: species richness (SR), evenness (Pielou index) uncertainty (Shannon index). Important Findings: Results showed that (i) N addition negatively affected SR in temperate, Plateau zones and subtropical zone, but had no significant effect on Shannon index in subtropical zones; (ii) N addition decreased SR, Shannon index and Pielou index in grassland, and the negative effect of N addition on SR was stronger in forest than in grassland; (iii) N addition negatively affected plant diversity (SR, Shannon index and Pielou index) in the long term, whereas it did not affect plant diversity in the short term. Furthermore, the increase in N addition levels strengthened the negative effect of N deposition on plant diversity with long experiment duration; and (iv) the negative effect of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) addition on SR was stronger than that of urea (CO(NH2)2) addition, but the negative effect of NH4NO3 addition on Pielou index was weaker than that of CO(NH2)2 addition. Our results indicated that the effects of N addition on plant diversity varied depending on climate zones, ecosystem types, N addition levels, N type and experiment duration. This underlines the importance of integrating multiple dimensions of plant diversity and multiple factors into assessments of plant diversity to global environmental change. © The Author(s) 2019.",Journal of Plant Ecology,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtz036' target='_blank'>10.1093/jpe/rtz036</a>,meta-analysis; itrogen addition; Pielou index; Shannon index; species richness,What are the effects of nitrogen deposition on terrestrial plant diversity in China?,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,3,Evidence Review
88458,Does biochar improve soil water retention? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Razzaghi, F.; Obour, P.B.; Arthur, E.",2019,"Biochar is widely suggested as a soil amendment to improve soil physical properties for crop production. However, the heterogeneity between experiments in terms of biochar characteristics, experimental conditions and soil properties makes it difficult to compare and extrapolate results from different studies. We conducted a statistical meta-analysis of literature published between 2010 and 2019, and quantified biochar's impacts on soil bulk density (BD) and water retention variables, namely, soil water content held at field capacity (FC), wilting point (WP) and plant available water content (AW). Across all soil textural groups, biochar on average decreased BD by 9%. FC and WP significantly increased for the coarse-textured soils (by 51% and 47%, respectively), and moderately for the medium-textured soils (by 13% and 9%, respectively). For the fine-textured soils, FC remained unchanged (<1%), but WP marginally decreased by 5%. Biochar significantly increased AW in the coarse-textured soils (by 45%) compared to the medium- and fine-textured soils (by 21% and 14%, respectively) suggesting that biochar may have greater benefit on coarse-textured soils. We introduced a novel parameter called ‘biochar carbon added’, estimated from biochar carbon content and the rate of application, which can be useful to make a sound comparison of biochar impacts on soil physical properties reported in different case studies when variable biochar attributes, experimental conditions and soil types have been used. The meta-analysis highlights again the need to provide adequate information on biochar experiments and soil water retention variables to allow better elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of biochar's impact on soil water retention and more. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Geoderma,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.114055' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.114055</a>,,How effective is biochar for improving soil bulk density and water retention?,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,Evidence Review

Materials and methods The original studies conducted on RKN control using organic amendments were identified using database and literature searches. The articles were screened and data were extracted. The publication bias of the studies was calculated. The soil amendments used in experiments were identified into four main organic amendment categories: plant residues, composts, animal manure and plant derivatives (powders, pellets or extracts produced from plant or plant parts). A meta-analysis was performed calculating the response ratios (effect size) of different organic amendments against RKN favouring plant performances. Results and discussion All the amendment types, i.e. plant residues, composts, animal manures and plant derivatives, were found to be effective against RKN. Plant-based derivatives were the most effective against all RKN damage attributes followed by application of compost and animal manure. Poultry manure was the only effective animal manure to control RKN consistently based on the results. Plant residues were found to be the least effective against RKN; amongst these groups of organic amendments, the family Poaceae produced the most effective residues to control RKN.

88451,Root and shoot competition lead to contrasting competitive outcomes under water stress: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Foxx, A.J.; Fort, F.",2019,"Background Competition is a critical process that shapes plant communities and interacts with environmental constraints. There are surprising knowledge gaps related to mechanisms that belie competitive processes, though important to natural communities and agricultural systems: the contribution of different plant parts on competitive outcomes and the effect of environmental constraints on these outcomes. Objective Studies that partition competition into root-only and shoot-only interactions assess whether plant parts impose different competitive intensities using physical partitions and serve as an important way to fill knowledge gaps. Given predicted drought escalation due to climate change, we focused a systematic review–including a meta-analysis on the effects of water supply and competitive outcomes. Methods We searched ISI Web of Science for peer-reviewed studies and found 2042 results. From which eleven suitable studies, five of which had extractable information of 80 effect sizes on 10 species to test these effects. We used a meta-analysis to compare the log response ratios (lnRR) on biomass for responses to competition between roots, shoots, and full plants at two water levels. Results Water availability treatment and competition treatment (root-only, shoot-only, and full plant competition) significantly interacted to affect plant growth responses (p < 0.0001). Root-only and full plant competition are more intense in low water availability (-1.2 and -0.9 mean lnRR, respectively) conditions than shoot-only competition (-0.2 mean lnRR). However, shoot-only competition in high water availability was the most intense (— 0.78 mean lnRR) compared to root-only and full competition (-0.5 and 0.61 mean lnRR, respectively) showing the opposite pattern to low water availability. These results also show that the intensity of full competition is similar to root-only competition and that low water availability intensifies root competition while weakening shoot competition. Conclusions The outcome that competition is most intense between roots at low water availability emphasizes the importance of root competition and these patterns of competition may shift in a changing climate, creating further urgency for further studies to fil knowledge gaps addressing issues of drought on plant interactions and communities. © 2019 Foxx, Fort.

As a result, various land restoration and conservation efforts are underway at different scales. Ethiopia is one of the countries with huge investments in land restoration. Tremendous land management practices have been implemented across the country since the 1970s. However, the spatial distribution of the interventions has not been documented, and there is no systematic, quantitative evidence on whether land restoration efforts have achieved the restoration of desired ecosystem services. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature related to land restoration efforts and their impacts in Ethiopia. Results show that most of the large-scale projects have been implemented in the highlands, specifically in Tigray and Amhara regions covering about 24 agroecological zones, and land restoration impact studies are mostly focused in the highlands but restricted in about 11 agroecological zones. The highest mean effect on agricultural productivity is obtained from the combination of bunds and biological interventions followed by conservation agriculture practices with 170% and 18% increases, respectively. However, bunds alone, biological intervention alone, and terracing (fanya juu) reveal negative effects on productivity. The mean effect of all land restoration interventions on soil organic carbon is positive, the highest effect being from 'bunds + biological' (139%) followed by exclosure (90%). Reduced soil erosion and runoff are the dominant impacts of all interventions. The results can be used to improve existing guidelines to better match land restoration options with specific desired ecosystem functions and services. Although the focus of this study was on the evaluation of the impacts of land restoration efforts on selected ecosystem services, impacts on livelihood and national socioeconomy have not been examined.

E.; Dempster, T.",2019,"The global expansion of aquaculture has raised concerns about its environmental impacts, including effects on wildlife. Aquaculture farms are thought to repel some species and function as either attractive population sinks ('ecological traps') or population sources for others. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of empirical studies documenting interactions between aquaculture operations and vertebrate wildlife. Farms were associated with elevated local abundance and diversity of wildlife, although this overall effect was strongly driven by aggregations of wild fish at sea cages and shellfish farms (abundance: 72x; species richness: 2.0x). Birds were also more diverse at farms (1.1x), but other taxa showed variable and comparatively small effects. Larger effects were reported when researchers selected featureless or unstructured habitats as reference sites. Evidence for aggregation 'hotspots' is clear in some systems, but we cannot determine whether farms act as ecological traps for most taxa, as few studies assess either habitat preference or fitness in wildlife. Fish collected near farms were larger and heavier with no change in body condition, but also faced higher risk of disease and parasitism. Birds and mammals were frequently reported preying on stock, but little data exist on the outcomes of such interactions for birds and mammals - farms are likely to function as ecological traps for many species.

Objective: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for the effect of short-term exposure to the natural environment on depressive mood. Methods: Five databases were systematically searched for relevant studies published up to March 2018. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) tool 1.0 and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool where appropriate. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of evidence overall. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. 20 potential moderators of the effect size were coded and the machine learning-based MetaForest algorithm was used to identify relevant moderators. These were then entered into a meta-regression. Results: 33 studies met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes ranged from −2.30 to 0.84, with an unweighted mean effect size of Mg=−0.29, SD=0.60. However, there was significant residual heterogeneity between studies and risk of bias was high. Type of natural environment, type of built environment, gender mix of the sample, and region of study origin, among others, were identified as relevant moderators but were not significant when entered in a meta-regression. The quality of evidence was rated very low to low. An assessment of publication bias was inconclusive. Conclusions: A small effect was found for reduction in depressive mood following exposure to the natural environment. However, the high risk of bias and low quality of studies limits confidence in the results. The variation in effect size also remains largely unexplained. It is recommended that future studies make use of reporting guidelines and aim to reduce the potential for bias where possible. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Environmental Research,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.108606' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.envres.2019.108606</a>,Built environment; Depression; Green space; Meta-analysis; Natural environment; Systematic review,What is the effect of short-term exposure to the natural environment on depressive mood?,4,3,3,2,4,4,2,3,3,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,Evidence Review

B.",2019,"Mangroves shift from carbon sinks to sources when affected by anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change (LULCC). Yet, the magnitude and temporal scale of these impacts are largely unknown. We undertook a systematic review to examine the influence of LULCC on mangrove carbon stocks and soil greenhouse gas (GHG) effluxes. A search of 478 data points from the peer-reviewed literature revealed a substantial reduction of biomass (82% +/- 35%) and soil (54% +/- 13%) carbon stocks due to LULCC. The relative loss depended on LULCC type, time since LULCC and geographical and climatic conditions of sites. We also observed that the loss of soil carbon stocks was linked to the decreased soil carbon content and increased soil bulk density over the first 100 cm depth. We found no significant effect of LULCC on soil GHG effluxes. Regeneration efforts (i.e. restoration, rehabilitation and afforestation) led to biomass recovery after similar to 40 years. However, we found no clear patterns of mangrove soil carbon stock re-establishment following biomass recovery. Our findings suggest that regeneration may help restore carbon stocks back to pre-disturbed levels over decadal to century time scales only, with a faster rate for biomass recovery than for soil carbon stocks. Therefore, improved mangrove ecosystem management by preventing further LULCC and promoting rehabilitation is fundamental for effective climate change mitigation policy.",Global Change Biology,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14774' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.14774</a>,,"What are the effects of land‐use and land‐cover change on mangrove blue carbon (soil carbon stock, bulk density, carbon content and carbon dioxide and methane effluxes)?",3,2,4,4,3,3,2,2,3,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,Evidence Review

Eighteen studies were rated as being of moderate quality, four studies of low quality, and four studies of high quality. Meta-analyses indicated that seated relaxation (g = .5, p = .06) and walking (g = .3, p = .02) in natural environments enhanced heart rate variability more than the same activities in control conditions.

However, the direct and indirect effects of these facilities on the mortality, occurrence and behaviour of rare and threatened species are poorly understood. We conducted a literature review to examine the potential impacts of WEF on grouse species. We studied whether grouse (1) collide with wind turbines, (2) show behavioural responses in relation to wind turbine developments, and (3) if there are documented effects of WEF on their population sizes or dynamics. Our review is based on 35 sources, including peer-reviewed articles as well as grey literature. Effects of wind turbine facilities on grouse have been studied for eight species. Five grouse species have been found to collide with wind turbines, in particular with the towers. Fifteen studies reported behavioural responses in relation to wind turbine facilities in grouse (seven species), including spatial avoidance, displacement of lekking or nesting sites, or the time invested in breeding vs. non-breeding behaviour. Grouse were affected at up to distances of 500 m by WEF infrastructure, with indications of effects also at bigger distances. In six cases, a local reduction in grouse abundance was reported in areas with wind turbines, which possibly affected population size. Due to the differences in study duration and design, we cannot provide general conclusions on the effects of WEF on grouse populations. We advise applying the precautionary principle by keeping grouse habitats free of wind energy developments, in particular where populations are small or locally threatened. Future studies should preferably apply a long-term before-after-control-impact design for multiple areas to allow for more general conclusions to be drawn on the effects of WEF on rare and threatened wildlife species. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.",Journal of Ornithology,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-019-01696-1' target='_blank'>10.1007/s10336-019-01696-1</a>,Before-after-control-impact design; Collision; Displacement; Habitat suitability; Tetraoninae; Wind turbine,What is the impact of wind energy facilities on grouse populations?,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,Evidence Review

Many contaminants alter behaviour at concentrations commonly experienced in the environment, with negative consequences for individual fitness, populations and communities. A comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of the behavioural sensitivity of amphibians is warranted to better understand the population-level and resultant ecological impacts of contaminants. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating behavioural changes following exposure to contaminants. Most studies were conducted in North America and Europe on larval stages, and 64% of the 116 studies focussed on the effects of insecticides. We found that a suite of contaminants influence a wide range of behaviours in amphibians, with insecticides typically invoking the strongest responses. In particular, insecticides increased rates of abnormal swimming, and reduced escape responses to simulated predator attacks. Our analysis identified five key needs for future research, in particular the need: (1) for researchers to provide more details of experimental protocols and results (2) to develop a strong research base for future quantitative reviews, (3) to broaden the suite of contaminants tested, (4) to better study and thus understand the effects of multiple stressors, and (5) to establish the ecological importance of behavioural alterations.

This review aims to investigate the effects of forest bathing on levels of salivary or serum cortisol as a stress biomarker in order to understand whether forest bathing can reduce stress. Medline/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were systematically searched for relevant articles. The quality of included trials was assessed following the criteria of the NIH dedicated tools. Afterwards, a qualitative and quantitative synthesis of retrieved evidence was performed. A total of 971 articles were screened; 22 of them were included in the systematic review and 8 in the meta-analysis. In all but two included studies, cortisol levels were significantly lower after intervention in forest groups if compared with control/comparison groups, or a significant pre-post reduction of cortisol levels was reported in the forest groups. The main results of the meta-analysis showed that salivary cortisol levels were significantly lower in the forest groups compared with the urban groups both before (MD = − 0.08 μg/dl [95% CI − 0.11 to − 0.05 μg/dl]; p &lt; 0.01; I 2 = 46%) and after intervention (MD = − 0.05 μg/dl [95% CI − 0.06 to − 0.04 μg/dl]; p &lt; 0.01; I 2 = 88%).

P.; Paschke, K.; Gebauer, P.",2019,"Aquaculture is currently one of the best prospects to helpmeet the growing need for protein in the human diet. However, aquaculture development and production result in consequences for the environment and also impact other productive activities. Salmon and trout cage culture has required the use of large quantities of pharmaceuticals in order to control outbreaks and the persistence of different pathogens, including sea lice (parasitic copepods), which cause economic losses of around 0.39 (sic) Kg(-1) of salmon produced. The pharmaceuticals currently used for the control of sea lice (cypermethrin, deltamethrin, azamethiphos, hydrogen peroxide) are applied by in situ immersion treatments, enclosing net pens using tarpaulin and then bathing fish with the pharmaceutical. After treatment the pharmaceuticals are released into the surrounding environment, exposing non-target species. Although the effects of such pharmaceutical exposure has been studied in some species, to date a systematic and exhaustive review of these potential effects has not yet been performed. In this study, an exhaustive review of the literature evaluating lethal and sub-lethal effects of anti-sea lice pharmaceuticals on non-target crustaceans and bivalves was performed, in order to assess the extent of the effects, toxicity, variables affecting such toxicity and identify potential synergistic effects previously unexplored. Our results show clear negative effects at concentrations lower than those used in treatments against sea lice in all of the species studied. Likewise, this study demonstrates knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in order to improve our understanding of the effects of these pharmaceuticals on non-target species, ecosystems in general and other productive activities.

88364,Bird guilds show different responses to tree retention levels: a meta-analysis,"Basile, M.; Mikusiński, G.; Storch, I.",2019,"Since the introduction of retention forestry in the 1990s, its practice has spread in the boreal and temperate regions. Its benefits for biodiversity are well recognised, and usually presented in the form of aggregated results for each taxonomic group. However, ameliorating effects of increased levels of retention on species with different ecological requirements is still not well studied. With this meta-analysis, we aim at disentangling the response of different bird guilds, considering the level of retention applied, as well as other confounding factors, such as the forest type or harvested area. We used a systematic review protocol and collected 30 studies which compared the response of birds to a gradient of retention levels against unharvested forests and/or clearcuts. Firstly, we compared the overall response of the full bird assemblage to retention, and found no differences in abundance and species richness between retention and unharvested forest, except for the abundance of some forest specialist species. Secondly, assessing the responses of various guilds showed that each bird guild can be affected very differently, according to their life history, biome, forest type and, most importantly, retention intensity. Results allow us to infer minimum retention levels needed to preserve each bird guild, admitting that other factors can play an important role in shaping the bird assemblage, often in interaction with retention. For example, canopy and cavity nesters showed a more positive response to lower levels of retention in mixed or broadleaved forests than in conifer forests. Our results indicate that minimum retention levels ranging between 40 and 60% of original habitat are needed, in order to maintain the same bird assemblage as in the autochthonous unharvested forest, with particular regard to the forest specialists. © 2019 The Authors",Global Ecology and Conservation,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00615' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00615</a>,Forest birds; Forest management; Forest specialists; Retention forestry; Selective harvest,What are the effects of retention forestry on the abundance and species richness of bird guilds?,3,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review
88354,A global synthesis of fire effects on pollinators,"Carbone, L.M.; Tavella, J.; Pausas, J.G.; Aguilar, R.",2019,"Aim: Understanding fire effects on pollinators is critical in the context of fire regime changes and the global pollination crisis. Through a systematic and quantitative review of the literature, we provide the first global assessment of pollinator responses to fire. We hypothesize that pollinators increase after fire and during the early postfire succession stages; however, high fire frequency has the opposite effect, decreasing pollinators. Location: Terrestrial ecosystems, excluding Antarctica. Time period: Data collected from 1973 to 2017. Major taxa studied: Insects (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera) and a few bird species. Methods: We first compiled available studies across the globe that assessed fire effects on pollinator communities. Then, by means of hierarchical meta-analyses, we evaluated how different fire regime parameters (fire frequency, postfire time and fire type) and habitat characteristics affect the abundance and richness of animals that act as pollinators. We also explored to what extent the responses vary among taxa groups and life history traits of pollinators (sociality system, nest location and feeding specialization), and among biomes. Results: The overall effect size of fire on pollinator abundance and richness across all studies was positive. Fire effect was especially clear and significant in early postfire communities, after wildfires, and for Hymenoptera. Taxonomic resolution influenced fire effects, where only studies at the species/genus and family levels showed significant effects. The main exceptions were recurrent fires that showed a negative effect, and especially wildfire effects on Lepidoptera abundance that showed a significant negative response. Main conclusions: Pollinators tend to be promoted after a wildfire event. However, short fire intervals may threat pollinators, and especially lepidopterans. Given the current fire regime changes at the global scale, it is imperative to monitor postfire pollinators across many ecosystems, as our results suggest that fire regime is critical in determining the dynamics of pollinator communities. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Global Ecology and Biogeography,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12939' target='_blank'>10.1111/geb.12939</a>,fire regime; floral visitors; meta-analysis; plant–animal interaction; pollinator abundance; pollinator richness; postfire age; systematic review,What are the effects of fire on the abundance or richness of a pollinator taxa?,3,2,3,2,3,2,2,1,1,3,2,2,3,3,2,3,Evidence Review

We investigated recovery processes in forests severely damaged by windthrow, by conducting a systematic quantitative literature review of 34 case studies. We addressed three questions on forest ecosystem recovery: (1) Which forest regeneration processes dominate forest recovery after windthrow? (2) Which structures and processes enhance or impede forest recovery after windthrow? (3) Does salvage logging after wind throw influence forest recovery? Our analyses showed that the main focus of the reviewed studies was on post storm seedling regeneration and survival. Advanced regeneration from suppressed seedlings or saplings also played an important role in the studies, especially for shade tolerant species and in the boreal biome. Pits and mounds and coarse woody debris played an important role for the establishment of Picea sp., especially in the studies from the boreal biome, whereas in the temperate biome game interference and competition from ground vegetation seemed to be the most important influencing processes. Salvage logging mostly acted as a subsequent disturbance after the windthrow, pushing the forest ecosystem towards an earlier successional stage, hereby impeding recovery. In none of the studies however, did the windthrow nor the consequent salvaging halt recovery completely, confirming the resilience of forests as the dominant vegetation type in these biomes.

L.; Hou, Y.; Oenema, O.; Zhang, F. S.",2019,"Recycling of livestock manure to agricultural land may reduce the use of synthetic fertilizer and thereby enhance the sustainability of food production. However, the effects of substitution of fertilizer by manure on crop yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and emissions of ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) as function of soil and manure properties, experimental duration and application strategies have not been quantified systematically and convincingly yet. Here, we present a meta-analysis of these effects using results of 143 published studies in China. Results indicate that the partial substitution of synthetic fertilizers by manure significantly increased the yield by 6.6% and 3.3% for upland crop and paddy rice, respectively, but full substitution significantly decreased yields (by 9.6% and 4.1%). The response of crop yields to manure substitution varied with soil pH and experimental durations, with relatively large positive responses in acidic soils and long-term experiments. NUE increased significantly at a moderate ratio (<40%) of substitution. NH3 emissions were significantly lower with full substitution (62%-77%), but not with partial substitution. Emissions of CH4 from paddy rice significantly increased with substitution ratio (SR), and varied by application rates and manure types, but N2O emissions decreased. The SR did not significantly influence N2O emissions from upland soils, and a relative scarcity of data on certain manure characteristic was found to hamper identification of the mechanisms. We derived overall mean N2O emission factors (EF) of 0.56% and 0.17%, as well as NH3 EFs of 11.1% and 6.5% for the manure N applied to upland and paddy soils, respectively.

In this systematic review, we provide a synthesis of the relationship between the presence of the most widely studied PPCPs in domestic wastewater and the conformation of the CWs and algae tanks constructed to treat them. The six drugs most commonly found in the reviewed articles were caffeine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen. Removal efficiency of the PPCPs was evaluated by means of the following selected parameters: hydraulic retention time (HRT), system flow rate, temperature, inflow concentration, and average removal rate. The average removal rate of PPCPs in CWs showed a positive and moderate relationship with the HRT (r = 0.346). A different flow configuration and plant species acted better for different target compounds. The average concentration reduction ranged from 80% for caffeine to zero reduction levels in some conformations for carbamazepine, diclofenac, and ketoprofen. There was a wide variation in the concentration reduction of different plant genera or unplanted tanks, ranging from 81% (caffeine using Phragmites sp.) to no reduction in an unplanted tank for diclofenac. The algae tanks were more efficient in removing most of the six target compounds than the wetlands. Removal rates ranged from 50% for ketoprofen to 16% for naproxen.

We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether vegetation and soil parameters at marsh sites restored through sediment addition recovered to levels found at paired reference sites. From 1342 candidate publications, we identified 25 studies (< 1 to > 30 years since initial restoration) suitable for quantitative meta-analysis. Vegetation cover was 50% lower at restored sites compared to reference sites over the first 5 years of restoration while aboveground biomass was 25% higher. On average, belowground parameters (root biomass and soil organic matter) were 44 to 92% lower at restored sites during the first 15 years of restoration compared to reference sites. Mean recovery trajectories for belowground biomass and productivity, vegetation cover, and soil parameters indicated that mean values for restored sites reached reference site conditions within 30 years following restoration. We also evaluated recovery curves for the 20th percentile of site data, which we suggest provides a valuable perspective for natural resource agencies to consider when evaluating individual projects, as it should ensure higher success rates compared with using mean recovery rates to estimate success. Understanding marsh recovery rates following restoration helps future restoration design and monitoring, but recovery rates vary across measurement endpoints.

M.",2019,"One of the main constraints affecting invertebrate diversity in many freshwater lentic habitats is the presence of a dry phase which forces aquatic organisms to avoid this period through the migration to other water bodies or the production of resting stages. Field studies show contradictory results when comparing invertebrate diversity in permanent (PW) and temporary lentic waters (TW). Our objective was to test how diversity is influenced by the permanence of water in lentic habitats, and which factors affect the magnitude and direction of this difference, including sampling design. Through a systematic review, 66 publications were selected and classified according to the sampling design (spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal datasets). Meta-analysis of the spatial dataset, which included 70% of the studies, revealed that diversity in PW was higher than in TW, and this difference was not influenced by annual precipitation, dispersal mode, habitat type or level of anthropogenic impact (proximity to urban or agricultural areas). We found a significantly higher effect size (PW greater than TW) when considering species richness rather than cumulative richness or Shannon diversity index, disconnected water bodies (hindering the exchange of individuals through water connection), organisms with passive dispersal (which cannot actively avoid the dry period), and study sites with high anthropogenic impact (where temporary habitats could undergo impacts; e.g. concentration of pollutants and eutrophication). We also found that the differences in diversity between PW and TW may decrease with increasing sampling effort. This result may be attributable to high species turnover due to the higher temporal environmental variation in TW relative to PW. Also, it indicates that sampling effort should be comparatively higher in TW to properly characterize the biodiversity in these environments in order to compare with PW. As global climate continues to change, our results suggest that loss in aquatic invertebrate diversity of TW will be likely to occur in regions where the frequency of drying events increases.",Freshwater Biology,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13409' target='_blank'>10.1111/fwb.13409</a>,,What is the impact of a dry phase on the invertebrate diversity in freshwater lentic water bodies?,3,2,3,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,2,Evidence Review

The physico-chemical character of biochar (pyrolyzed crop residue) has been shown to augment SC levels. This review systematically compares the environmental and economic benefits of applying crop residue versus biochar produced from crop residues to soils and the potential implications for SC sequestration. Crop residues enhance the mineralization rate of SC, while biochar can increase or decrease SC depending on the types of biochar/soil and duration.

S.; Rpenter Rc, Ecological Monographs V. P.",2019,"Wild large herbivores are declining worldwide. Despite extensive use of exclosure experiments to investigate herbivore impacts, there is little consensus on the effects of wild large herbivores on ecosystem function. Of the ecosystem functions likely impacted, we reviewed the five most-studied in exclosure experiments: ecosystem resilience/resistance to disturbance, nutrient cycling, carbon cycling, plant regeneration, and primary productivity. Experimental data on large wild herbivores' effects on ecosystem functions were predominately derived from temperate grasslands (50% grasslands, 75% temperate zones). Additionally, data were from experiments that may not be of adequate size (median size 400 m(2) despite excluding all experiments below 25 m(2)) or duration (median duration 6 years) to capture ecosystem-scale responses to these low-density and wide-ranging taxa. Wild herbivore removal frequently impacted ecosystem functions; for example, net carbon uptake increased by three times in some instances. However, the magnitude and direction of effects, even within a single function, were highly variable. A focus on carbon cycling highlighted challenges in interpreting effects on a single function. While the effect of large herbivore exclusion on carbon cycling was slightly positive when its components (e.g. pools vs. fluxes of carbon) were aggregated, effects on individual components were variable and sometimes opposed. Given modern declines in large wild herbivores, it is critical to understand their effects on ecosystem function. However, this synthesis highlights strong variability in direction, magnitude, and modifiers of these effects. Some variation is likely due to disparity in what components are used to describe a given function. For example, for the carbon cycle we identified eight distinctly meaningful components, which are not easily combined yet are potentially misrepresentative of the larger cycle when considered alone. However, much of the observed difference in responses likely reflects real ecological variability across complex systems. To move towards a general predictive framework we must identify where variation in effect is due to methodological differences and where due to ecosystem context. Two critical steps forward are (a) additional quantitative synthetic analyses of large herbivores' effects on individual functions, and (b) improved, increased systematic exclosure research focusing on effects of large herbivores' exclusion on functions.

In this systematic review, we quantify the available evidence of successful biological control in coffee agroforestry. There is a recent research trend of switching from the traditional focus on classical biological control to conservation biocontrol, considering a broad range of enemy groups inhabiting the cropping system. We found 19 papers proving CBB biocontrol success in the field and 25 studies suggesting potential biocontrol. Most papers showed effects of fungal infections, followed by papers on ant communities, parasitic Hymenoptera, birds, and nematodes. With respect to local coffee management, arboreal canopy cover providing shade as well as organic practices enhances biocontrol success. Landscape-scale studies are almost missing, although CBB predation by birds can be significant and benefits from the presence of forest patches in the surrounding landscape. Insectivorous birds successfully reduce yield losses by CBB, whereas in many other taxa there is a need for identifying economic impacts of biocontrol.

88308,"Contrasting global effects of woody plant removal on ecosystem structure, function and composition","Ding, J.; Eldridge, D.J.",2019,"Encroachment of woody plants into savannas and grasslands has increased markedly over the past century due to global changes in climate and intensified land use disturbance (e.g., grazing, fire). Removal of woody plants is mostly used globally to attempt to reinstate open woodlands and grasslands to increase forage plant production for livestock. However, there is still considerable controversy over the effectiveness of different removal programs and a global synthesis of removal impacts on ecosystem processes is still lacking, limiting our ability to provide ecologically-based advice on how best to manage woody encroachment. We used a global meta-analysis to explore the effects of woody plant removal on ecosystems. Analyses of 263 publications revealed that the overall effect of removal varied among different ecosystem response variables, with increases in composition (e.g., grass richness), reductions in structure (e.g., biocrust cover, woody plant cover and density), but no effects on function (e.g., increases in grass biomass, which compensated for reductions in soil roughness and shrub biomass). The outcomes of woody plant removal depended strongly on environmental context and woody plant traits, with removal more effective in mesic areas, but varied depending on both aboveground and belowground traits of the plants (e.g. plant shape, root types). Effectiveness of woody plant removal was relatively short-lived (i.e. within 5 years), but legacy effects on ecosystem function were generally large, negative, and lasted for up to 10 years. Our results highlight the wide disparity in removal outcomes, and reinforce the notion that the impacts of removal are strongly context dependent, vary with treatment methods, and generally ecologically undesirable in the long term. As climate changes, woody plant removal will become less effective due to drier climates and increased woody expansion. Treatment methods should be targeted to specific management goals (e.g., pastoral production or ecosystem conservation), and particular ecosystem outcomes (e.g. ecosystem structure, or function or composition) to improve the efficiency of woody removal in global savannas under the changing climate. © 2019","Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics",<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ppees.2019.125460' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.ppees.2019.125460</a>,Clearing; Ecosystem impacts; Encroachment; Global synthesis; Meta-analysis; Woody removal,"What are the effects of woody plant removal on ecosystem structure, function and composition?",2,2,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,3,1,1,3,2,2,1,Evidence Review

Micropterus salmoides (Lacepède, 1802) is often introduced for sport fishing purposes and is broadly distributed worldwide; it has been listed by IUCN as one of the 100 of the world’s worst invasive alien species. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using the ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases to synthesize the existing knowledge concerning introductions of M. salmoides introductions and their ecological impacts. We highlight major trends and gaps related to spatiotemporal patterns of the publications, research methods and ecological impacts. The number of publications relating to impacts of M. salmoides began to grow in the 1990’s and has been increasing in the last years. Studies of the species’ impact have been conducted in 16 countries, primarily in the Palearctic realm. There is a lack of studies in tropical and megadiverse regions. Most of the studies used field observational methodologies, with only a few theoretical studies. Most of the field observational studies were conducted in rivers and reservoirs. Impacts at the population and community levels, such as the local extirpation of native species and food web changes, were described more often than impacts at other biological levels.

This is particularly important considering the recent growing number of restoration initiatives worldwide encouraging forest cover expansion, mainly by tree planting. Here, we conducted a systematic review of scientific literature reporting infiltration measurements in forests restored by tree planting in the tropics and subtropics. We found 11 studies representing 67 data comparisons in eight countries. Overall results indicate that infiltration increases but is not fully recovered to reference conditions in forests restored by tree planting. Recovery of infiltration varied depending on land-use, soil texture and restoration age. Recovery of infiltration was higher for cultivated than for pastures and bare soils. Clayey soils had higher infiltration recovery than sandy soils. Our findings identified some knowledge gaps that should be addressed to improve our understanding of when and why tree planting to restore forests may promote the recovery of infiltration in tropical and subtropical soils. First, information about recovery of infiltration capacities when using tree planting for forest restoration results are scarce. Second, infiltration in restored forests should be monitored over time, including long-term studies and measurements on water movement through the soil profile and evaluating potential interactions between infiltration and soil attributes. Details on the effects that different forest restoration techniques (e.g., soil preparation, tree species diversity and densities) could have on infiltration is virtually unknown.

Given the complex chemical composition of wastewater, toxicity removal is an integral parameter to assess the performance of WWTPs. Thus, the goal of this systematic review is to evaluate how effectively ozonation and activated carbon remove in vitro and in vivo toxicity. Out of 2464 publications, we extracted 46 relevant studies conducted at 22 pilot or full-scale WWTPs. We performed a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of in vitro (100 assays) and in vivo data (20 species), respectively. Data is more abundant on ozonation (573 data points) than on an activated carbon treatment (162 data points), and certain in vitro end points (especially estrogenicity) and in vivo models (e.g., daphnids) dominate. The literature shows that while a conventional treatment effectively reduces toxicity, residual effects in the effluents may represent a risk to the receiving ecosystem on the basis of effect-based trigger values. In general, an upgrade to ozonation or activated carbon treatment will significantly increase toxicity removal with similar performance. Nevertheless, ozonation generates toxic transformation products that can be removed by a post-treatment.

E.",2019,"This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of no-till (NT) based on recent studies (post-2000) in NW Europe and evaluates the separate effect of the NT and other associated practices (e.g. cover crops, crop residue and crop rotations) individually and collectively on the water purification and retention functions of the soil. It also assesses the applicability of NT compared to conventional tillage (CT) systems with reference to a number of soil physical characteristics and processes known to have an important influence on water purification and retention functions. The literature search was carried out by a systematic approach where NT practices were assessed against soil structure, erosion, nutrient leaching/loss, water retention, infiltration and hydraulic conductivity (combinations of criteria = 40). Articles were selected based on their relevance in relation to the topic and location within NW Europe (n = 174). Results show that NT has large potential as an erosion mitigation measure in NW Europe with significant reductions of soil losses from agricultural fields, providing potential beneficial effects regarding inputs of sediment and particulate phosphorous (P) to water bodies. However, NT increased losses of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and had little effect on nitrogen (N) leaching, limiting the overall positive effects on water purification. Soil structural properties were often found to be poorer under NT than CT soils, resulting in decreased water infiltration rates and lower hydraulic conductivity. This was an effect of increased topsoil compaction, reduced porosity and high bulk density under NT, caused by the absence of topsoil inversion that breaks up compacted topsoil pans and enhances porosity under CT. However, several studies showed that soil structure under NT could be improved considerably by introducing cover crops, but root and canopy characteristics of the cover crop are crucial to the achieve the desired effect (e.g. thick rooted cover crops beneficial to soil structural remediation can cause negative effects in soils sensitive to erosion) and should be considered carefully before implementation.

E.; Lapointe, N. W. R.; Janusz, R.; Clarke, K.; Tonn, B.; Walsh, J. C.; Cooke, S. J.",2019,"Background: Habitat is the foundation for healthy and productive fisheries. For fish that require substrate for spawning, lack of appropriate spawning substrate is inherently limiting and a lack of access to suitable spawning habitat will lead to population collapse. To ensure management resources are being allocated wisely and conservation targets are being achieved, there is an increased need to consider the effectiveness of techniques to enhance or create habitat that has been lost. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of techniques currently used to create or enhance spawning habitat for substrate-spawning (including vegetation-spawning) fish in temperate regions, and to investigate the factors that influence the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement. Methods: Searches for primary research studies on the effect of spawning habitat creation or enhancement for substrate-spawning fish were conducted in bibliographic databases, on websites and an online search engine, through evidence call-outs, social media, and Advisory Team contacts, and in the bibliographies of relevant reviews. All articles were screened at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text), with consistency checks being performed at each stage. Relevant articles were critically appraised and meta-data and quantitative data were extracted into a database. All included studies were described narratively and studies that met the criteria for meta-analysis were analyzed quantitatively. Review findings: A total of 75 studies from 64 articles were included in this systematic review and underwent data extraction and critical appraisal. The majority of these studies were from North America (78.1%) and a large percentage (63.7%) targeted salmonids. We conducted a meta-analysis using data from 22 studies with 53 data sets. Available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., gravel, cobble) was effective in increasing the abundance of substrate-spawning fish compared to controls, with a taxonomic bias towards salmonids (5/6 data sets). The addition of plant material (e.g., large woody debris) with or without physical alterations to the waterbody (e.g., excavation) was also effective in increasing substrate-spawning fish abundance on average compared to controls. Egg life stages (i.e., nests, redds, zygotes or developing embryos) were associated with larger increases in abundance with habitat creation or enhancement than age-0 life stages (i.e., alevin, fry, young-of-the-year). We found no detectable effect of ecosystem type (lotic vs. lentic waterbodies) or time since habitat creation or enhancement on intervention effectiveness for fish abundance. Conclusions: The synthesis of available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., addition of gravel, substrate washing) was an effective means of enhancing spawning habitat, but results may only be applicable for salmonids. Furthermore, the synthesis suggests that on average, the addition of plant material with or without waterbody modifications was also effective at increasing fish abundance. Overall, we were limited in our ability to address many of the questions that stakeholders have regarding the circumstances under which spawning habitat creation or enhancement is effective for substrate-spawning fish. Before we can provide recommendations with a higher level of certainty, we need to improve research and reporting, and expand research focus to include a broader range of species and intervention types.

J.",2019,"Cover crops can reportedly improve soil fertility, suppress weed growth and pest pressure, and contribute to cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yield improvements. To systematically evaluate cover crop effects on cotton yield and weed suppression, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis investigating 10 moderating variables in 104 articles, yielding 1117 independent studies over 48 yr. Globally, cover crops increased cottonseed and lint yield by 6 and 5%, respectively, while decreasing weed biomass by 20%. Overall, leguminous cover crops increased seed cotton yield by 17 to 43% (Vicia spp. and Pisum spp., respectively). Monocots, nonlegume dicots, and legumes were effective at suppressing weed growth (21, 52, and 10%, respectively). Incorporation of cover crops by tillage (rather than chemical burn down) resulted in lint (14%) and seed (42%) yield increases. Cover crops increased cotton yields markedly on loamy soils, whereas there were lesser increases for other textures (p > 0.05). Greater efficacy of cover crops at controlling weeds was proportionate to soil silt content, which was inversely related to sand content. In addition, cover crops were effective at controlling multiple types of weed species; however, weed species with shorter maximum heights were most suppressed by cover crops. Overall, cover crops had a positive effect on cotton yield and weed suppression. Their effectiveness, however, can vary depending on soil texture, management strategy, and cover crop or weed genera.

88284,The application of bioturbators for aquatic bioremediation: Review and meta-analysis,"Gonzalez, S.V.; Johnston, E.; Gribben, P.E.; Dafforn, K.",2019,"Human activities introduce significant contamination into aquatic systems that impact biodiversity and ecosystem function. Many contaminants accumulate, and remediation options are now required worldwide. One method for bioremediation involves the application of macrofauna to stimulate microbial ecosystem processes including contaminant removal. However, if we are to confidently apply such a technique, we need clarity on the effect of bioturbators on different contaminants and how these vary under different environmental scenarios. Here we used a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyse current knowledge on the activities of bioturbating macrofauna in contaminated sediments and quantify how bioturbation-bioremediation changes depend on the taxonomic group, the aquatic ecosystem and important environmental variables. Three common contaminant classes were reviewed and analysed: metals, nutrients (i.e. ammonia and phosphorous)and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). In addition, meta-regressions were calculated to estimate the effect of environmental and experimental design variables on effect sizes. Meta-analytic results revealed that deeper burrowing and more active sediment surface animals (e.g. polychaetes)increased metal release from sediments, nutrients and oxygen uptake by microbial fractions in comparison to bioturbators that inhabit shallower depths in sediments. In addition, there was a different effect of bioturbators on response variables in different aquatic systems. Finally, bioturbator effects on nutrient and metal release appeared modulated by context-specific variables such as temperature, pH, sediment grain size, animal density and experimental duration. Our findings highlight critical knowledge gaps such as field applications, less studied macrobenthic fauna and the incorporation of molecular approaches.

This paper has discussed and compared the mechanisms, effects and affecting factors of major contemporary strategies, including soil amendment with biochar, biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) and applications of synthetic nitrification inhibitor (NI), urease inhibitor (UI), hydrogel and slow-/controlled-release fertilizer (SRF/CRF). Among these strategies, soil amendment with biochar seems to be the most promising, considering its demonstrated effectiveness and sustainable nature.

A database model has been proposed in this review to link the production, properties and performance of biochar and delve into the valuable information scattered in current and future biochar studies. At the same time, the other strategies should also be continuously studied for improvement. NIs and UIs need to be more stable and lasting; hydrogels and SRFs/CRFs have to be more environmentally friendly and economically sound; BNI deserves broader investigations and its future applications can be more widespread.

The abundance below docks was on average 18% of that in controls, and areas with boat traffic had on average 42% of the abundance in control areas.

However, the conditions under which this combination (hereafter ISFM) improves nutrient and water use efficiency and crop yields have not been systematically studied. Therefore, we undertook a meta-analysis of studies conducted in rain-fed maize production systems across SSA with the objective of (1) quantifying the magnitude of improvement in grain yield, rain use efficiency (RUE), agronomic efficiency of nitrogen (AEN) and phosphorus (AEP) due to ISFM; (2) determining conditions under which ISFM achieves greater yield response, RUE, AEN and AEP; and (3) compare yield responses to the substitutive and additive approaches of ISFM with sole application of cattle manure. Application of high rates of cattle manure in combination with high N fertilizer rates increased yield response only by 27.5%, but it achieved 47% lower AEN and 27% lower AEP relative to a combination of low manure and low N fertilizer rate. The substitutive approach of ISFM achieved 54% greater AEN and 16% greater AEP than the additive ISFM approach. Yield response and AEN also significantly varied with soil type. On most soil types, AEN was 2-195% lower under sole manure than under ISFM or sole fertilizer.

88255,Impacts of dead wood manipulation on the biodiversity of temperate and boreal forests. A systematic review,"Sandstrom, J.; Bernes, C.; Junninen, K.; Lohmus, A.; Macdonald, E.; Muller, J.; Jonsson, B. G.",2019,"Dead wood (DW) provides critical habitat for thousands of species in forests, but its amount, quality and diversity have been heavily reduced by forestry. Therefore, interventions aiming to increase DW might be necessary to support its associated biodiversity, even in protected forests, which may be former production forests. Our aim was to synthesize the current state of knowledge drawn from replicated experimental studies into solid quantitative evidence of the effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity, with a focus on protected forests. We conducted a full systematic review of effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity in boreal and temperate regions. We included three intervention types: creation of DW from live trees at the site, addition of DW from outside the site and prescribed burning. Outcomes included abundance and species richness of saproxylic insects, ground insects, wood-inhabiting fungi, lichens, reptiles and cavity-nesting birds. In total, we included 91 studies, 37 of which were used in meta-analyses. Although meta-analysis outcomes were heterogeneous, they showed that increasing the amount of DW ('DW enrichment') has positive effects on the abundance and richness of saproxylic insects and fungi. The positive effect on saproxylic pest insect abundance tended to be less than that on saproxylic insects in general. No significant effects were found for ground insects or cavity-nesting birds. Although reviewed studies were mainly short term, our results support that management that increases DW amounts has the potential to increase the abundance of DW-dependent species and, in most cases, also their species richness. Studies of burning showed positive effects on the abundance of saproxylic insects similar to those of other interventions, even though burning on average resulted in a smaller enrichment of DW amounts. Policy implications. The findings of the review suggest that manipulating dead wood (DW) can be an effective part of conservation management to support biodiversity in protected areas. The findings also indicate that the diversity of DW types is important, a mix of DW qualities should be favoured. Burning seems to be an effective method to increase biodiversity but to benefit cavity-nesting birds, snag losses need to be minimized.",Journal of Applied Ecology,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13395' target='_blank'>10.1111/1365-2664.13395</a>,,What are the effects of dead wood manipulation on biodiversity of temperate and boreal forests?,4,3,4,3,4,1,4,3,4,4,3,3,4,4,2,2,Evidence Review

To fill this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 55 peer-reviewed publications describing assessments of river restoration with indicators of biodiversity or ecosystem services (ES). The core of the study was to identify: (i) the overall ecological effects of river restoration; (ii) the restoration effects on different organism groups and types of ES, including the relationship between biodiversity and ES; and (iii) the influence of the restoration context, that is degradation types, restoration techniques and restoration age. The meta-analysis revealed that river restoration significantly enhanced ecological conditions. However, restoration effects varied among organism groups and ES, with plant abundance and regulating services showing higher responses to restoration. Moreover, a trend of a positive correlation was found between biodiversity and ES. Restoration activities showed most significant effects in the context of hydromorphological degradation or land-use changes, and channel reconfiguration and riparian buffer establishment had a particularly favourable outcomes. Only regulating services showed a positive correlation with restoration age; thus, long-time monitoring is necessary to fully understand restoration effects.

A global meta-analysis,"Casimiro, M.S.; Sansevero, J.B.B.; Queiroz, J.M.",2019,"The development of easily observable measures of restoration success is essential for monitoring of the ambitious proposed global restoration targets (e.g. The Bonn Challenge; New York Declaration on Forests). Systematic reviews with meta-analyses are a good way to evaluate the performance of different organisms in the monitoring of ecological restoration. Among the arthropods, ants have a long history in environmental monitoring. We compiled a data set and performed a global meta-analysis encompassing studies conducted in different ecosystems around the world to investigate whether richness and composition of species or functional groups (FG) of ant communities can be predicted during the restoration process. Moreover, we aimed to understand the influence of restoration technique (natural regeneration or active restoration), ecosystem type (temperate or tropical), and past land use (mining or pasture) on ant communities in areas undergoing restoration processes. Notwithstanding the varied conditions in which the studies were carried out, our meta-analysis showed that reestablishment of ant FG takes place more quickly than species richness. The recovery of ant diversity is faster in tropical ecosystems and areas under natural regeneration can have higher ant diversity than the reference areas. In temperate ecosystems, mined areas under restoration are less likely to recover the number of species than FG richness. Both species and FG composition were less predictable in our meta-analysis. As the publication of new datasets is increasing, we hope that future meta-analyses can build on the present study to further describe and understand the patterns in ant communities to be used as indicators of ecosystem restoration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Ecological Indicators,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.018' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.018</a>,,"What is the impact of restoration technique (natural regeneration or active restoration), ecosystem type (temperate or tropical), and past land use (mining or pasture) on ant communities in areas undergoing restoration?",3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,Evidence Review
88249,The effect of urbanization on freshwater macroinvertebrates – Knowledge gaps and future research directions,"Gál, B.; Szivák, I.; Heino, J.; Schmera, D.",2019,"Understanding the effects of urbanization on the diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates is an important topic of biodiversity research and has direct conservation relevance. The absence of evidence-based systematic overviews on this topic motivated us to perform meta-analyses and to synthetize the present state of knowledge. We observed significant heterogeneity among individual case studies, reporting negative, neutral and positive effects. As expected, urbanization had an overall negative effect on the diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates. These results are based mainly on the study of lotic (stream and river) ecosystems because there are insufficient data available for lentic (pond and lake) ecosystems. Compared to individual case studies, the present review reports an evidence-based synthesis for the first time. We identified knowledge gaps regarding case studies reporting the effects of urbanization on pond and lake ecosystems, case studies examining the phylogenetic and functional facets of biodiversity, as well case studies investigating the effect of urbanization on the beta diversity component of macroinvertebrate communities. The identification of these knowledge gaps allowed us to make recommendations for future research: (1) report results on specific taxonomic groups and not only the entire macroinvertebrate community, (2) study the impacts of urbanization on macroinvertebrate diversity in different habitat types and understudied continents, (3) focus on the functional and phylogenetic facets of diversity and (4) examine community differentiation (e.g. beta diversity) in urban freshwater ecosystems. Our results also suggested that the analysis of diversity- environment relationships is crucial for developing macroinvertebrate indicators especially in the increasingly urbanized world. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Ecological Indicators,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.012' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.012</a>,,What is the effect of urbanization on freshwater macroinvertebrate diversity?,2,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,2,Evidence Review

K.; Stelter, R.",2019,"Background The effect of nature-based interventions on self-reported mental well-being in patients with physical disease is gaining increasing attention. However, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials investigating this area. Due to the massive costs in health care systems, there is a need for new strategies to address these issues and an urgent need for attention to this field. Nature-based interventions are low cost, easy to implement, and should get attention within the health care field. Therefore, the objective was to find the impact of nature interventions on mental well-being in humans with a physical disease. Methods In four major databases (PubMed, Cinahl, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library), a systematic review of quantitative studies of nature's impact on self-reported mental health in patients with physical disease was performed. A total of 1909 articles were retrieved but only five met the inclusion criteria and were summarized. Results All five studies were quantitative, with a control group and a nature-based intervention. A source of heterogeneity was identified: the patients in one of the five studies were psychosomatic. In the four studies with somatic patients, significant benefit of nature on self-reported mental health outcomes was found; the only study that failed to show a significant benefit was the one with psychosomatic patients. Conclusion A significant effect of nature on mental well-being of patients with somatic disease was found. The result in patients with psychosomatic disease is inconclusive, and more studies in this category are needed.

88241,Worldwide decline of the entomofauna: A review of its drivers,"Sanchez-Bayo, F.; Wyckhuys, K. A. G.",2019,"Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.",Biological Conservation,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.01.020' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.biocon.2019.01.020</a>,,"What are the effects of habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and climate change on global entomofauna populations?",2,1,2,2,3,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review
88227,Global meta-analysis of soil-disturbing vertebrates reveals strong effects on ecosystem patterns and processes,"Mallen-Cooper, M.; Nakagawa, S.; Eldridge, D.J.",2019,"Aim: Organisms that disturb the soil while foraging or creating shelter (ecosystem engineers) can have profound effects on ecosystems. Soil ejecta from these disturbances can enhance surface nutrients and the resulting depressions accrue organic matter and develop into biological hotspots. Here, we describe a global meta-analysis of studies that assessed the impacts of vertebrate soil disturbance on both biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Location: Global land surface. Time period: 1941–2016. Major taxa studied: Vertebrates. Methods: After conducting a systematic literature search, we quantitatively synthesized the findings of 149 published studies that compared disturbed and undisturbed surfaces. Our meta-analysis included 64 engineer species, primarily comprised of rodents and a subset of other mammals. Results: We found that vertebrate soil disturbance significantly enhanced soil nitrogen (by 77%) and phosphorus (35%), and the productivity (32%) and recruitment (32%) of vascular plants. Disturbances had a greater cover of bare soil (126%) than undisturbed controls, and higher abundances of secondary vertebrates (1,233%), that use pre-constructed burrows as shelter and foraging grounds. Soil disturbance significantly reduced water run-off (63%) and the abundance of biocrusts (82%). Soil disturbance effects generally intensified with increasing aridity, and the magnitude of soil disturbance effects was not moderated by the area of the disturbance. Disturbances older than 12 months were more distinct from the surrounding matrix than fresh disturbances. The phylogeny of engineers was unrelated to their ecosystem effects, indicating that the same functionality could readily evolve in different taxa. Main conclusions: In general, disturbances become localized patches of elevated functioning, providing strong evidence that vertebrate engineers, especially those in drylands, are an important source of environmental heterogeneity. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Global Ecology and Biogeography,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12877' target='_blank'>10.1111/geb.12877</a>,,"What are the impacts of soil‐disturbing vertebrates on soil properties and measures of plant and invertebrate diversity, abundance and biomass?",2,2,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review
88203,The 4 per 1000 goal and soil carbon storage under agroforestry and conservation agriculture systems in sub-Saharan Africa.,"Corbeels, M.; Cardinael, R.; Naudin, K.; Guibert, H.; Torquebiau, E.",2019,"The 4 per mil initiative launched by the French government at COP21 in Paris in December 2015 aspires to increase global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at a rate of 0.4% per year. We conducted a systematic literature review on SOC storage under agroforestry and conservation agriculture systems in sub-Saharan Africa, where we reported 66 and 33 cases for both systems respectively. The results showed that SOC storage rates were significantly higher than 4 per mil yr-1 in fallows and in multistrata agroforestry systems (P=0.0001 and 0.0178, respectively), but not in alley cropping and parklands systems. For conservation agriculture, SOC storage rates were only significantly higher than 4 per mil yr-1 (P=0.0438) when all three principles were applied, i.e. no- or minimum tillage combined with crop residue retention and intercropping or rotation. The data showed very large variability in SOC storage rates as the result of various factors, including previous land-use history, experimental set up and approach used to determine SOC storage (diachronic versus synchronic approach), soil type, depth of soil sampling, type of crops and management, and duration of the experiment. SOC storage rates significantly decreased with time in the agroforestry systems (P=0.0328). However, we were unable to find significant relationships with initial SOC stocks or tree density. Given the limited published data and the high variability in results, no significant relationships between SOC storage rates and site variables were found for conservation agriculture. We argue that there is a potential for SOC storage in agricultural soils of sub-Saharan Africa, as illustrated by SOC gaps observed on smallholder farms. Low SOC levels are, however, to a great extent the result of limited resources of most smallholder farmers. Practices such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture can restore SOC in these soils, but the 4 per mil initiative has to be implemented on the grounds of the positive impact on crop productivity rather than on climate change mitigation. The efficiency in doing so will depend on the specific situations and will need economic support to smallholder farmers, including the promotion of good markets for sale of extra produce and for input supply, effective private support and policy, such as credit schemes and subsidies for inputs, and efficient extension services which incentivize farmers to invest in new technologies.",Soil & Tillage Research,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2018.02.015' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.still.2018.02.015</a>,,How effective are agroforestry and conservation agriculture systems for achieving the 4 per 1000 goal of soil carbon storage in sub-Saharan Africa?,2,2,3,2,3,1,2,2,1,2,3,1,3,2,2,2,Evidence Review
88206,Impact of structural habitat modifications in coastal temperate systems on fish recruitment: A systematic review,"Macura, B.; Byström, P.; Airoldi, L.; Eriksson, B.K.; Rudstam, L.; Støttrup, J.G.",2019,"Background: Shallow nearshore marine ecosystems are changing at an increasing rate due to a range of human activities such as urbanisation and commercial development. As a result, an increasing number of structural modifications occur in coastal nursery and spawning habitats of fish. Concomitant to this increase, there have been declines in many coastal fish populations and changes in the composition of fish communities. As requested by Swedish stakeholders, this review aimed to synthesise scientific evidence of the impact on fish recruitment of structural modifications in temperate coastal areas. Methods: We searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature on such impacts in English, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, German, Swedish and Spanish. Searches were performed in bibliographic databases, specialist websites, bibliographies of review articles. We also contacted stakeholder to find relevant literature. Eligible studies included small- and large-scale field studies in marine systems and large lakes (&gt; 10,000 km 2 ) in temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Included replicated comparisons of fish recruitment between altered and unaltered control areas, comparisons before and after an alteration, or both. Relevant outcomes (response variables) included measures of recruitment defined as abundance of juvenile fish in coastal habitats. All fish species were considered. Articles were screened for eligibility by title, abstract and full text. Eligible studies were critically appraised based on their external and internal validity. From each eligible study of sufficient validity, we extracted information on study design, measured outcomes, exposure, type of comparator, effect modifiers and study findings. Study findings were synthesised narratively. Results: We searched for eligible studies in 15 databases, 24 specialist websites, Google Scholar, and bibliographies of 11 review articles. The review finally included 37 studies that were eligible and of sufficient validity to be considered for final synthesis. Most studies (23 of 37) were from the Northern Hemisphere. Studies varied in design, spatial resolution, target fish species, and type of structural habitat change. This high level of variation did not allow for a quantitative synthesis and prevented us from drawing general conclusions on the impact of structures or structural modifications on fish recruitment. In this review we provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence base and classify eligible studies into six categories (based on type of exposure and comparator). The categories are as follows: the impacts on fish recruitment of: (1) artificial structures in coastal areas, (2) structures designed as fish attractors, (3) large scale urban sprawl, (4) 'novel' habitats, (5) habitat loss, and (6) restoration. Conclusions: This review revealed a very limited evidence base for how structural modifications and marine urban sprawl can affect fish recruitment. Thus, there is a substantial mismatch between stakeholder needs and research evidence. Further, the impact and ecological performance of artificial structures depend both on context and species. Clearly, there is a need for more research on the subject, especially on long-term consequences at larger spatial scales. © 2019 The Author(s).",Environmental Evidence,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-019-0157-3' target='_blank'>10.1186/s13750-019-0157-3</a>,Artificial structures; Coastal development; Coastal habitat loss; Juvenile fish; Marine urban sprawl; Nursery; Physical habitat change; Spawning ground; Young-of-the-year; YOY,What are the effects of anthropogenic structural habitat modifcations in coastal temperate systems on fish recruitment?,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,4,3,3,4,1,2,4,Evidence Review

Results were analyzed for case studies versus climatological assessments, observational versus modeling studies and for day versus night. Results highlight that urbanization modifies rainfall, such that mean precipitation is enhanced by 18% downwind of the city, 16% over the city, 2% on the left and 4% on the right with respect to the storm direction. The rainfall enhancement occurred approximately 20-50 km from the city center. Study results help develop a more complete picture of the role of urban processes in rainfall modification and highlight that rainfall increases not only downwind of the city but also over the city.

H.",2019,"A substantial number of experiments have so far been carried out to study the response of the C-N-P stoichiometry of terrestrial plants to the rising CO2 level of the earth. However, there is a need of systematic evaluation for assessing the impact of the elevated CO2 on plant C-N-P stoichiometry. In the present investigation, a comprehensive meta-analysis involving 386 published reports and including 4481 observations has been carried out. The goal of the research was to determine the response of plants to their C-N-P stoichiometry due to elevated levels of global atmospheric CO2. The results showed that rising CO2 altered the concentration of C (+2.19%, P < 0.05), N (-9.73%, P < 0.001) and P (-3.23%, P < 0.001) and C: N (+13.29%, P < 0.001) and N: P ratios (-7.32%, P < 0.0001). Overall, a slightly increasing trend in the C: P ratio (P > 0.05) in the plant was observed. However, plant leaf, shoot and herbaceous type of plants showed more sensitivity to rising CO2. CO2 magnitude exhibited a positive effect (P < 0.05) on C: N ratio. Additionally, ' CO2 acclimation' hypothesis as proposed by the authors of the current paper was also tested in the study. Results obtained, especially, show changes of C and N concentrations and C: P ratio to an obvious down-regulation for long-term CO2 fumigation. At spatial scales, a reduction of plant N concentration was found to be higher in the southern hemisphere. The CO2 enrichment methods affected the plant C-N-P stoichiometry. Compared to FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment), OTC (open top chamber) showed larger changes of C, N, P, and N: P. The results of the present study should, therefore, become helpful to offer a better understanding towards the response of the terrestrial plant C-N-P stoichiometry to an elevated global atmospheric CO2 in the future.

Our review updates an earlier review, whose searches were conducted in April 2010. Trials were eligible if: (a) participants in an outdoor or virtual exercise condition were exposed to views of nature (green exercise); (b) green exercise was compared with indoor exercise with no exposure to nature; (c) included an outcome related to physical or mental health; (d) used comparative or crossover trial design. We searched the following databases from 1st January 2010 to 28th June 2018: PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, GreenFile, and Sports DISCUS. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Where possible we conducted a meta-analysis using the inverse variance random-effects method, and where this approach was not possible we presented the results qualitatively and in harvest plots. We identified 28 eligible trials. In a meta-analysis of just three longitudinal trials, the only statistical finding was slightly lower post-intervention perceived exertion with green versus indoor exercise (mean difference: -1.02; 95% confidence intervals: -1.88, -0.16). Compared with indoor exercise, acute bouts of outdoor green exercise may favorably influence affective valence and enjoyment, but not emotion, perceived exertion, exercise intensity, and biological markers. No other consistent statistical differences were observed, apart from a higher enjoyment of outdoor green versus virtual green exercise. We found a high risk of bias across trials and an overall low quality of evidence. In conclusion, there was limited evidence to support the view that green exercise offers superior benefits to exercise without exposure to nature. The low quality of evidence prohibits clear interpretation of trial findings.

Several studies have examined the ties between green space and academic performance, hypothesizing that green space can foster performance, and, over time, help reduce such disparities. Although numerous reviews have analyzed the link between nature and child health, none have focused on academic achievement. Methods: We identified 13 peer-reviewed articles that examined associations between academic outcomes, types of green spaces, and distances in which green spaces were measured around schools. Results: Of the 122 findings reported in the 13 articles, 64% were non-significant, 8% were significant and negative, and 28% were significant and positive.

88146,Crop Yield Responses to Sulfur Fertilization in Brazilian No-Till Soils: a Systematic Review,"Pias, O. H. D.; Tiecher, T.; Cherubin, M. R.; Mazurana, M.; Bayer, C.",2019,"Sulfur (S) fertilization recommendations for grain crops in Brazil were formerly established from studies on crops with a low yield potential grown on soils under conventional tillage (CT). However, the subsequent adoption of no-tillage (NT) altered S dynamics in the soil, making it necessary to carefully evaluate the applicability of these S fertilizer recommendations. In addition, the emergence of modem high-yield-potential genotypes, the successive application of concentrated low-sulfur fertilizers, and reduction in S atmospheric deposition have raised the likelihood of positive responses of crops to S fertilization. Available literature reports contrasting crop responses to S fertilization in Brazilian soils, ranging from substantial gains to slight yield losses depending on the particular crop, soil, and climate. The primary aim of this study was to examine available data for crop grain responses to S application in NT soils in order to ascertain whether existing recommendations established for Brazilian CT soils also hold for NT soils. A systematic review of data from 35 scientific publications spanning 58 crop harvests revealed a positive yield response to S fertilization in 31 % of the crop harvests, with an average yield increase of 16 %. Crops on soils with available SO42--S contents above the critical level (viz., 7.5 mg dm(-3)) exhibited no positive response to S fertilization in any crop harvest (n = 18). Dry edible bean and com were the most responsive crops, and canola and wheat, the least. For the trials with positive crop responses, a fertilizer rate of 26 kg ha(-1) S sufficed to obtain at least 95 % of the maximum possible yield. In general, the S fertilization recommendations previously established for CT soil proved effective with grain crops on NT soils as a result of the critical levels of soil available SO42--S and the fact that the recommended S rates are similar to those found in this study considering trials conducted under NT conditions only. However, existing recommendations could be improved by using additional criteria for soils with available SO42--S contents below the critical level since a positive response was observed in 22 % (n = 18) and 92 % (n = 12) of the crop harvests under a subtropical and a tropical climate, respectively. Our results suggest that S fertilization must be prioritized in NT soils with available SO42--S contents below 7.5 mg dm(-3) in the 0.00-0.20 m layer, especially in tropical climate zones. In addition, regional fertilizer recommendation guidelines should consider crop type and yield expectation in order to facilitate more sustainable S management and increased crop yields in Brazil.",Revista Brasileira De Ciencia Do Solo,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/18069657rbcs20180078' target='_blank'>10.1590/18069657rbcs20180078</a>,,What are the effects of sulfur fertilization on grain crop yields in Brazilian no-till soils?,2,2,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,2,1,2,1,Evidence Review

R.; Gresswell, R. E.; Lintermans, M.; Prior, K. A.; Pellatt, M. G.; Vis, C.; Cooke, S. J.",2019,"In aquatic systems, biological invasions can result in adverse ecological effects. Management techniques available for non-native fish removal programs (including eradication and population size control) vary widely, but include chemicals, harvest regimes, physical removal, or biological control. For management agencies, deciding on what non-native fish removal program to use has been challenging because there is little reliable information about the relative effectiveness of these measures in controlling or eradicating non-native fish. We conducted a systematic review, including a critical appraisal of study validity, to assess the effectiveness of different non-native fish removal methods and to identify the factors that influence the overall success rate of each type of method. We found 95 relevant studies, generating 158 data sets. The evidence base was dominated by poorly documented studies with inadequate experimental designs (76% of removal projects). When the management goal was non-native fish eradication, chemical treatments were relatively successful (antimycin 89%; rotenone 75%) compared with other interventions. Electrofishing and passive removal measure studies indicated successful eradication was possible (58% each) but required intensive effort and multiple treatments over a number of years. Of these studies with sufficient information, electrofishing had the highest success for population size control (56% of data sets). Overall, inadequate data quality and completeness severely limited our ability to make strong conclusions about the relationships between non-native fish abundance and different methods of eradication and population control and the factors influencing the overall success rate of each method. Our review highlights that there is considerable scope for improving our evaluations of non-native fish removal methods. It is recommended that programs should have explicitly stated objectives, better data reporting, and study designs that (when possible and appropriate) incorporate replicated and controlled investigations with rigorous, long-term quantitative monitoring. Future research on the effectiveness of non-native fish removal methods should focus on: (i) the efficacy of existing or potentially new removal measures in larger, more complex environments; (ii) a broader range of removal measures in general; and (iii) phenotypic characteristics of individual fish within a population that fail to be eradicated or controlled.",Environmental Reviews,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1139/er-2018-0049' target='_blank'>10.1139/er-2018-0049</a>,,How effective are non-native fish removal techniques in freshwater ecosystems?,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,3,4,1,2,4,Evidence Review

F.; Vanacker, V.; Mao, Z.; Stokes, A.; Mathez-Stiefel, S. L.",2019,"Several Andean countries have planned to restore forest cover in degraded land to enhance the provision of multiple ecosystem services in response to international commitments such as the Bonn Challenge. Hydrological services, e.g. water supply, hydrological regulation and erosion mitigation, are particularly important to sustain the life of more than fifty million Andean people. While rapid and important forest cover changes have occurred during recent decades, critical information on the impact of forestation on hydrological services has not yet been synthesized in the context of Andean ecosystems. We define forestation as the establishment of forest by plantation or natural regeneration on areas that either had forest in the past or not. To help improve decision-making on forestation in the Andes, we reviewed the available literature concerning the impacts of forestation on water supply, hydrological regulation and mitigation of erosion and landslides. We also examined available data on the most relevant hydrological processes such as infiltration, evapotranspiration and runoff in forest stands. Hydrological services from native forests were also included as a reference state for comparing processes and services provided by forestation. Following systematic review protocols, we synthesized 155 studies using different methods, including meta-analyses and meta-regressions. Results show that forestation has had clear impacts on degraded soils, through reducing water erosion of soils and risk of moderate floods, increasing soil infiltration rate by 8 and topsoil organic matter (SOM). We found that 20 years of tree plantation was sufficient to recover infiltration rate and sediment yield close to the levels of native forests whereas SOM, soil water storage and surface runoff of native forests could not be recovered by forestation in the time scales examined. The benefits in terms of hydrological regulation are at the expense of a reduction in total water supply since forest cover was associated with higher water use in most Andean regions. Forestation with native species was under-epresented in the reviewed studies. The impact of forestation on landslides has also been largely overlooked in the Andes. At high elevations, exotic tree plantations on Andean grasslands (e.g. paramo and puna) had the most detrimental consequences since these grasslands showed an excellent capacity for hydrological regulation and erosion mitigation but also a water yield up to 40% higher than tree plantations.

J.",2018,"Bottom-contact fishing gears are globally the most widespread anthropogenic sources of direct disturbance to the seabed and associated biota. Managing these fishing disturbances requires quantification of gear impacts on biota and the rate of recovery following disturbance. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of 122 experiments on the effects-of-bottom fishing to quantify the removal of benthos in the path of the fishing gear and to estimate rates of recovery following disturbance. A gear pass reduced benthic invertebrate abundance by 26% and species richness by 19%. The effect was strongly gear-specific, with gears that penetrate deeper into the sediment having a significantly larger impact than those that penetrate less. Sediment composition (% mud and presence of biogenic habitat) and the history of fishing disturbance prior to an experimental fishing event were also important predictors of depletion, with communities in areas that were not previously fished, predominantly muddy or biogenic habitats being more strongly affected by fishing. Sessile and low mobility biota with longer life-spans such as sponges, soft corals and bivalves took much longer to recover after fishing (>3 year) than mobile biota with shorter life-spans such as polychaetes and malacostracans (<1 year). This meta-analysis provides insights into the dynamics of recovery. Our estimates of depletion along with estimates of recovery rates and large-scale, high-resolution maps of fishing frequency and habitat will support more rigorous assessment of the environmental impacts of bottom-contact gears, thus supporting better informed choices in trade-offs between environmental impacts and fish production.",Fish and Fisheries,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.12283' target='_blank'>10.1111/faf.12283</a>,,What are the effects of bottom fishing on abundance and species richness of benthic fauna?,3,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,4,4,1,4,2,2,2,Evidence Review

C.; Uddling, J.; Mills, G.",2018,"Tropospheric ozone is known to adversely affect crops and other vegetation. Most studies have focussed on the effects of elevated ozone levels vs. present ambient. We investigated the effect of present ambient surface ozone (O-3) concentrations vs. preindustrial on a range of agronomically important response variables in field-grown wheat, using results from 33 experiments (representing 9 countries, 3 continents, 17 cultivars plus one set of 4 cultivars) having both charcoal filtered (CF) and non-filtered (NF) air treatments. Average filtration efficiency was 62%, reducing the O-3 concentration from 35.6 +/- 10.6 SD ppb in NF to 13.7 +/- 8.8 SD ppb in CF. Average CF concentrations were in the range of levels believed to represent pre-industrial conditions, while NF concentrations were 7% lower than in the ambient air at plant height on the experimental sites. NF had significant (p < 0.05) negative effects compared to CF on grain yield (-8.4%), grain mass (-3.7%), harvest index (-2.4%), total above-ground biomass (-5.4%), starch concentration (-3.0%), starch yield (-10.9%), and protein yield (-6.2%). No significant effect was found for grain number and protein concentration. There was a significant relationship between the effect of filtration on grain yield and the difference in O-3 concentration between NF and CF treatments. The average yield loss per ppb O-3 removed was 0.38% and did not systematically vary with year of experiment (ranging from 1982 to 2010) or with the average O-3 level in the experiments. Although there are many differences among the field experiments included in this meta-analysis (e.g. genotype, degree of O-3 pollution of the site and year, nutrient and soil condition, filtration efficiency), our study clearly shows that there is a consistent and significant effect of present ambient O-3 exposure on a range of important response variables in wheat, the most strongly affected being starch yield.

Here, we present the first quantitative systematic review of this form, using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success has been evaluated for a broad range of taxa and life histories, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants and long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. We found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success to be a feature of every hypothesis we tested. However, establishment success most critically depended on propagule pressures in the range of 10–100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated primarily with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. Conversely, no variation was accounted for in any analysis by the scale of study (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy) used.

In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta-analytic approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments, Hedges' g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation temperatures (absolute effect: |g| = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this influence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted, with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = −8.42). Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology, performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival. Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least one-year post-hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential to impact fitness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6°C versus 2°C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the treatments fluctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they were constant. The effect also depended on the mid-temperature of the comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest temperatures under climatic change. © 2017 Cambridge Philosophical Society",Biological Reviews,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12333' target='_blank'>10.1111/brv.12333</a>,,What are the effects of increased incubation temperature on reptile phenotypic traits?,3,2,3,2,3,1,2,2,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,2,Evidence Review

The literature is not affected by publication bias, but the results vary systematically depending on the exact data and methodology applied. Using Bayesian model averaging we identify the most important factors driving the heterogeneity of the reported effects: data frequency, estimation technique (simulation vs. regression), and, importantly, the latitude of the country considered.

Previous reviews suggest that environmental changes will substantially affect future yields of starchy dietary staples. To date, no comprehensive global analysis of the impacts of environmental change on (nonstaple) vegetables and legumes-important constituents of healthy diets-has been reported. We systematically searched for articles published between 1975 and 2016 on the effects of ambient temperature, tropospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and ozone (O-3) concentrations, water availability, and salinization on yields and nutritional quality of vegetables and legumes. We estimated mean effects of standardized environmental changes using observed exposure-response relationships and conducted meta-analyses where possible. We identified 174 relevant papers reporting 1,540 experiments. The mean (95% CI) reported yield changes for all vegetables and legumes combined were +22.0% (+11.6% to +32.5%) for a 250-ppm increase in CO2 concentration, -8.9% (-15.6% to -2.2%) for a 25% increase in O-3 concentration,-34.7% (-44.6% to -24.9%) for a 50% reduction in water availability, and -2.3% (-3.7% to -0.9%) for a 25% increase in salinity. In papers with baseline temperatures >20 degrees C, a 4 degrees C increase in temperature reduced mean yields by -31.5% (-41.4% to -21.5%). Impacts of environmental changes on nutritional quality were mixed.

A.",2018,"Aim: Across the planet, grass-dominated biomes are experiencing shrub encroachment driven by atmospheric CO2 enrichment and land-use change. By altering resource structure and availability, shrub encroachment may have important impacts on vertebrate communities. We sought to determine the magnitude and variability of these effects across climatic gradients, continents, and taxa, and to learn whether shrub thinning restores the structure of vertebrate communities. Location: Worldwide. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Terrestrial vertebrates. Methods: We estimated relationships between percentage shrub cover and the structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities (species richness, Shannon diversity and community abundance) in experimentally thinned and unmanipulated shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes using systematic review and meta-analyses of 43 studies published from 1978 to 2016. We modelled the effects of continent, biome, mean annual precipitation, net primary productivity and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the relationship between shrub cover and vertebrate community structure. Results: Species richness, Shannon diversity and total abundance had no consistent relationship with shrub encroachment and experimental thinning did not reverse encroachment effects on vertebrate communities. However, some effects of shrub encroachment on vertebrate communities differed with net primary productivity, amongst vertebrate groups, and across continents. Encroachment had negative effects on vertebrate diversity at low net primary productivity. Mammalian and herpetofaunal diversity decreased with shrub encroachment. Shrub encroachment also had negative effects on species richness and total abundance in Africa but positive effects in North America. Main conclusions: Biodiversity conservation and mitigation efforts responding to shrub encroachment should focus on low-productivity locations, on mammals and herpetofauna, and in Africa. However, targeted research in neglected regions such as central Asia and India will be needed to fill important gaps in our knowledge of shrub encroachment effects on vertebrates.

S.; Voss, M.",2018,"Ocean acidification (OA), arising from the influx of anthropogenically generated carbon, poses a massive threat to the ocean ecosystems. Our knowledge of the effects of elevated anthropogenic CO2 in marine waters and its effect on the performance of single species, trophic interactions, and ecosystems is increasing rapidly. However, our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients such as nitrogen is less advanced and lacks a comprehensive overview of how these processes may change under OA. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of eight major nitrogen transformation processes incorporating 49 publications to synthesize current scientific understanding of the effect of OA on nitrogen cycling in the future ocean by 2100. The following points were identified by our meta-analysis: (a) Diazotrophic nitrogen fixation is likely enhanced by 29% +/- 4% under OA; (b) species- and strain-specific responses of nitrogen fixers to OA were detectable, which may result in alterations in microbial community composition in the future ocean; (c) nitrification processes were reduced by a factor of 29% +/- 10%; (d) declines in nitrification rates were not reflected by nitrifier abundance; and (e) contrasting results in unispecific culture experiments versus natural communities were apparent for nitrogen fixation and denitrification. The net effect of the nitrogen cycle process responses also suggests there may be a shift in the relative nitrogen pools, with excess ammonium originating from CO2-fertilized diazotrophs. This regenerated inorganic nitrogen may recycle in the upper water column increasing the relative importance of the ammonium-fueled regenerated production. However, several feedback mechanisms with other chemical cycles, such as oxygen, and interaction with other climate change stressors may counteract these findings.

A recent review by Ohly and colleagues (2016) uncovered substantial ambiguity surrounding details of directed attention and how cognitive restoration was tested. Therefore, an updated systematic review was conducted to identify relevant cognitive domains from which to describe elements of directed attention sensitive to the restoration effect. Forty-two articles that tested natural environments or stimuli against a suitable control, and included an objective measure of cognitive performance, had been published since July 2013. Articles were subjected to screening procedures and quality appraisal. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled effect sizes across 8 cognitive domains using data from 49 individual outcome measures. Results showed that working memory, cognitive flexibility, and to a less-reliable degree, attentional control, are improved after exposure to natural environments, with low to moderate effect sizes. Moderator analyses revealed that actual exposures to real environments may enhance the restoration effect within these three domains, relative to virtual exposures; however, this may also be due to differences in the typical lengths of exposure. The effect of a participants' restoration potential, based upon diagnosis or fatigue-induction, was less clear. A new framework is presented to qualify the involvement of directed attention-related processes, using examples of tasks from the three cognitive domains found to be sensitive to the restoration effect.

A.",2018,"There is increasing scientific and public concern over the presence of microplastics in the natural environment. We present the results of a systematic review of the literature to assess the weight of evidence for microplastics causing environmental harm. We conclude that microplastics do occur in surface water and sediments. Fragments and fibers predominate, with beads making up only a small proportion of the detected microplastic types. Concentrations detected are orders of magnitude lower than those reported to affect endpoints such as biochemistry, feeding, reproduction, growth, tissue inflammation and mortality in organisms. The evidence for microplastics acting as a vector for hydrophobic organic compounds to accumulate in organisms is also weak. The available data therefore suggest that these materials are not causing harm to the environment. There is, however, a mismatch between the particle types, size ranges, and concentrations of microplastics used in laboratory tests and those measured in the environment. Select environmental compartments have also received limited attention. There is an urgent need for studies that address this mismatch by performing high quality and more holistic monitoring studies alongside more environmentally realistic effects studies.

88025,Conservation of grasslands and savannas: a meta-analysis on mammalian responses to anthropogenic disturbance,"Lima, D. O. de; Lorini, M. L.; Vieira, M. V.",2018,"Grasslands and savannas are among the most degraded biomes in the world. These biomes face a diverse number of anthropogenic threats, and despite this scenario, little attention is given to their conservation and sustainable use. This meta-analysis aims to analyze the effect of anthropogenic activities on the abundance of native mammals in these grassy ecosystems. A systematic research in the literature was carried out in order to find studies that analyzed variations in abundance of mammals in response to an anthropogenic activity in any grassland, savanna or shrubland environment around the world. After filtering, 24 studies were analyzed, generating 202 effect sizes for five anthropogenic factors: cropland activities (32 effect sizes - ES); cattle ranching (58 ES); fire (30 ES); shrub/woody encroachment (56 ES) and urbanization (26 ES). Analyzed papers included field data from all continents. In general, mammalian abundance is decreasing under anthropogenic disturbance, as shown by the general effect size. This result highlights the need for more intense conservation programs in grasslands and savannas, since its species are under threat. When comparing the different anthropogenic threats, only cropland activities affected mammals significantly, reducing their abundance. The estimate of the mean effect of cattle ranching, fire, shrub/woody encroachment and urbanization on abundance of mammals did not differ from zero. However, for cattle ranching, fire and shrub/woody encroachment the mean effects measured had large confidence intervals, indicating that these mean effects could not be estimated accurately. Cattle ranching, fire and shrub/woody encroachment effects on mammalian abundance probably depend on their intensity and on the environmental characteristics of each ecosystem, and therefore each case must be analyzed in an ecosystem-specific perspective. Urbanization did not affect mammals, although this anthropogenic activity was analyzed only in two ecosystems where these urban areas do not cover bigger areas. Considering global necessity of maintaining and even increasing food production, we suggest that the cropland activities, which were the greatest threat to the abundance of mammals, should be used in a land sparing perspective. Meanwhile, cattle ranching could be used in a land sharing perspective, provided that cattle density will be restricted to such levels that could also guarantee the conservation of native species. Further studies regarding other taxa are desirable to confirm this recommendation considering the overall grassland and savanna biodiversity.",Journal for Nature Conservation,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2018.08.008' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.jnc.2018.08.008</a>,,What is the effect of anthropogenic activities on abundance of mammal species in grasslands and savannas?,3,2,3,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,2,Evidence Review

With the establishment of new plantations on the rise, a review of the literature examining their impacts on local communities is needed to inform policies and practices. In this systematic review, we followed an a priori protocol to reduce the selection biases inherent to conventional literature reviews, and considered both grey and peer-reviewed literature. Of the 20,450 studies identified in our literature search, only 92 studies met our predefined inclusion criteria. However, only 22 studies presented a clear comparator and considered confounding factors in their analysis. Of the 251 impacts identified in this sample, most impacts across the nine categories were characterised as predominantly negative impacts attributed to large-scale tree plantations. Impacts on employment (22% of reported impacts/of which 41% predominantly negative), land (21%/81%), livelihoods (12%/48%) and the often intertwined social impacts (20%/69%) were the most commonly considered categories, within which a majority of studies agreed on the impact dynamics when in similar contexts, resembling the dynamics observed in other large-scale land-based investments. Most impacts were reported from Southeast Asia (34% of reported impacts), South America (29%), Africa (23%) and Australasia (12%). We corroborate that costs of large-scale tree plantations for residents tend to be front-loaded, especially when plantations have displaced customary land uses, and possible benefits to accrue over time, moderated by the emergence of local processing and complementary livelihood activities. However, given the methodological inconsistencies in our sample and the under-representation of areas known to have undergone plantation development, strong global evidence on the long-term socio-economic impacts of large-scale tree plantations remains limited.",Global Environmental Change,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.09.001' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.09.001</a>,,What are the effects of large-scale tree plantations for local communities on human well-being?,4,3,4,4,4,1,2,2,1,4,2,1,4,1,2,3,Evidence Review

However, the magnitude of manure application impacts on SOC changes as compared with conventional mineral fertilizers still needs to be better assessed. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to address the effects of various fertilization practices on SOC changes in China's arable topsoil. The analysis was based on 148 peer reviewed articles reporting 69 sites and 729 observations with an average experimental duration of 18 years across China. We compared the response of SOC content to application of manure alone (M) or manure plus mineral fertilizers (NPKM) with the SOC response to NPK or no fertilizers (Control). We systematically analyzed how SOC responses were influenced by different environmental and management factors (land use, climate and soil properties, etc.). First, the retention coefficient of manure was used to present the percentage of C input from manure 'converted' to SOC. Compared to Control, on average, manure had C-retention coefficients of 31%±12% (95% Confidence Interval, CI) and 18%±2% for the experimental duration of ≤10 years and >10 years, respectively. When compared to NPK, manure had C-retention coefficients of 29%±13% and 9%±3% for the experimental duration of ≤10 years and >10 years, respectively. In addition, compared to Control and NPK, application of manure increased SOC content by 0.23-0.26 and 0.18-0.19 g kg-1 yr-1, respectively. The results also indicated that the mean differences of SOC change between the treatments with or without manure application were mainly controlled by soil properties (28-43%) and anthropogenic farming practices (21-27%).

Water and N have highly variable effects on tomato yield, water-use efficiency (WUE) and N-use efficiency (NUE), which may be due to the effect of cultivar, growing season and water and N inputs. Despite these strong effects, no systematic investigation had been conducted into the effects of N and water on yield, WUE, and NUE in tomatoes. The water-saving potential (WSP) and N-saving potential (NSP) have also not been systematically estimated. In this study, we use meta-analysis of 49 studies with 733 individual observations across 10 countries to determine the effect on yield, WUE, and NUE. The global average yield was 16.43-37.02 t ha-1, while the median yields ranged from 41.75 to 130.59 t ha-1. Median values for WUE and NUE were 7.09 to 34.63 kg m-3 and 208.1 to 2050 kg kg-1, respectively. Yield was correlated with temperature, water input and N input. Optimizing inputs of both water and N must consider their interaction to ensure consistency between high yield, WUE and NUE. Our results indicated that decreasing a supra-optimal water input to an optimal input would increase yield by 9.8%, WUE by 19.6% and NUE by 3.7% and that decreasing a supra-optimal N input to an optimal input would increase yield by 5.6%, WUE by 6.3% and NUE by 50.5%. WSP and NSP could be decreased by 41% (240 mm) and 37% (138 kg N ha-1), respectively, without decreasing yield.

This could lead to fewer large catastrophic wildfires in the future. However, we must consider the public health impacts of the smoke that is emitted from wildland and prescribed fire. The objective of this synthesis is to examine the differences in ambient community-level exposures to particulate matter (PM2.5) from smoke in the United States in relation to two smoke exposure scenarios-wildfire fire and prescribed fire. A systematic search was conducted to identify scientific papers to be included in this review. TheWeb of Science Core Collection and PubMed, for scientific papers, and Google Scholar were used to identify any grey literature or reports to be included in this review. Sixteen studies that examined particulate matter exposure from smoke were identified for this synthesis-nine wildland fire studies and seven prescribed fire studies. PM2.5 concentrations from wildfire smoke were found to be significantly lower than reported PM2.5 concentrations from prescribed fire smoke. Wildfire studies focused on assessing air quality impacts to communities that were nearby fires and urban centers that were far from wildfires. However, the prescribed fire studies used air monitoring methods that focused on characterizing exposures and emissions directly from, and next to, the burns.

With this review, we aimed to investigate the importance of temperature on reproductive phenophase transitions (i.e., maturation and release of propagules) of temperate seaweeds while discussing how global warming might affect their reproductive phenology. A systematic literature search returned a total of 81 relevant papers, which were reviewed for evidence of environmental, factors (including temperature) driving reproductive phenology. Only a few of studies reported effects of temperature on propagule release (spores and gametes). In contrast, reproductive maturation (both sporogenesis and gametogenesis) was found predominantly to be controlled by temperature. Our findings highlight the potential for phenological shifts in seaweeds in response to ocean warming. In contrast to the consistent advancement of spring events observed for terrestrial plants, there was evidence that warming can both advance and delay the timing of reproductive events for temperate seaweeds, especially the maturation of propagules. Because temperature was often found to act in combination with either day length or spectral composition, ocean warming might result in a mismatch between light and temperature requirements that could lead to reduced reproductive performance. © 2018 de Bettignies, Wernberg and Gurgel.",Frontiers in Marine Science,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00218' target='_blank'>10.3389/fmars.2018.00218</a>,"temperate macroalgae, life cycle, phenophase, sporogenesis, gametogenesis, reproduction, warming, herbarium data",What is the effect of temperature on the reproductive phenology of temperate seaweeds?,3,1,2,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,2,Evidence Review

The Environmental and Socio-Economic Impact Classification of Alien Species (EICAT and SEICAT) are two methodologies that facilitate such comparisons. They classify alien taxa along a 5-level, semi-quantitative scale based on the magnitude of their impacts on the environment and human well-being, respectively. In this study, we applied both protocols to seven invasive marine fishes that are already considered 'high-risk' and have been singled out for monitoring in relation to fisheries in the Mediterranean (Plotosus lineatus, Pterois miles/volitans, Fistularia commersonii, Lagocephalus sceleratus, Siganus rivulatus/Siganus luridus and Saurida lessepsianus). Here, we focus in particular on their socio-economic impacts. By systematically reviewing the published literature and scoring the demonstrated impacts we show that the taxa with the highest environmental impacts (Major) are P. miles/volitans and the two siganids. In contrast, L. sceleratus had the highest socio-economic impact (Moderate) and highest number of impact records. The high and uniform densities of P. lineatus caused widespread, albeit less severe, impacts in the invaded areas. Human activities that are primarily affected by the selected taxa are commercial and recreational fishing and other recreational uses of the sea through impacts on, mainly, material assets and human health. We found significant data gaps regarding the species' environmental impacts, especially relating to predation, and make specific recommendations for future research. The links between environmental and socio-economic impacts, especially their cultural dimensions, are poorly documented and require novel approaches.

However, flow recommendations are typically based on expert opinion rather than a rigorous test of the available evidence. We used rapid evidence synthesis to systematically review the literature on responses of several native Australian fish to flow-related and other important environmental variables, and tested 13 explicit hypotheses. The hypotheses were related to the condition, reproduction and survival of pygmy perches, carp gudgeons, blackfish and flat-headed gudgeons. The evidence was insufficient to reach strong conclusions for all but three of our hypotheses. Late-spring high flows are associated with increased survival of pygmy perches and carp gudgeons, and exotic fish are associated with decreased survival of these fishes. The evidence that warmer spring water temperatures enhance their reproduction was inconsistent.

The presence of cattle within the riparian zone is a common feature of grazing ventures, but can negatively impact on the functionality of riparian ecosystems. Therefore, the provision of offstream watering points (OSWPs) as an alternative watering source for cattle may lessen or prevent the impact cattle have on the riparian zone. A systematic review was conducted to identify: 1) which factors influence how cattle use OSWPs, and 2) if the provision of an OSWP is an effective best management practice to reduce the time cattle spent in riparian zones, potentially limiting the impact cattle may have on instream water quality and riparian habitat particularly stream bank vegetation. A total of 37 from 1135 research papers satisfied the initial selection criteria for the review with seven providing sufficient information to conduct a meta-analysis. Out of the 37 papers a total of seven factors and five sub-factors influencing cattle's use of OSWPs were identified. There is evidence that OSWPs did reduce the time cattle spent in riparian zones, however with great variation (63.7%) among studies.

Restoration often involves mechanical thinning to promote development of complex habitats in moist, productive forests and mechanical thinning with prescribed fire to reduce fuels and restore natural disturbance regimes in dry, fire prone forests. This systematic review quantified the impact of restoration treatments on forest ecosystem carbon (C) stocks and identified factors that moderate treatment effects across spatial and temporal scales. Our review process identified 73 studies to be included for analysis, from which we calculated 482 estimates of treatment effect size. We found that restoration treatments significantly reduce C. Prescribed fire had larger impacts on belowground than aboveground carbon pools, while thinning and combined treatments had larger impacts on aboveground pools. The available literature is highly skewed toward shorter timescales (<25 years after treatment), small spatial scales, and is geographically concentrated: 41% of estimated effect sizes came from studies in the Sierra Nevada. Thinning had similar effects on forest carbon in dry forests and moist forests. The relative magnitude of total C losses was significantly less from simulation than empirical studies, although simulations also mostly evaluated long-term impacts (>75 years after treatment) while empirical studies mostly looked at short term (<25 year) effects. Post-treatment wildfire significantly reduced the percentage of carbon lost relative to controls in the aboveground pool. Long-term, treated stands only recovered to control levels of carbon when wildfire was present. Returns on the carbon debt imposed by thinning and prescribed fire depend on the nuances of the treatments themselves but may also depend upon treatment intensity and the frequency and intensity of future wildfire.

E.",2018,"Urbanization is one of the most extreme forms of environmental alteration, posing a major threat to biodiversity. We studied the effects of urbanization on avian communities via a systematic review using hierarchical and categorical meta-analyses. Altogether, we found 42 observations from 37 case studies for species richness and 23 observations from 20 case studies for abundance. Urbanization had an overall strong negative effect on bird species richness, whereas abundance increased marginally with urbanization. There was no evidence that city size played a role in influencing the relationship between urbanization and either species richness or abundance. Studies that examined long gradients (i.e. from urban to rural) were more likely to detect negative urbanization effects on species richness than studies that considered short gradients (i.e. urban vs. suburban or urban vs. rural areas). In contrast, we found little evidence that the effect of urbanization on abundance was influenced by gradient length. Effects of urbanization on species richness were more negative for studies including public green spaces (parks and other amenity areas) in the sampled landscapes. In contrast, studies performed solely in the urban matrix (i.e. no green spaces) revealed a strong positive effect on bird abundance. When performing subset analyses on urban-suburban, suburban-rural and suburban-natural comparisons, species richness decreased from natural to urban areas, but with a stronger decrease at the urban-suburban interface, whereas bird abundance showed a clear intermediate peak along the urban-rural gradient although abundance in natural areas was comparable to that in suburban areas. This suggests that species loss happens especially at the urban-suburban interface, and that the highest abundances occur in suburban areas compared to urban or rural areas.

While there have been numerous reviews of empirical studies on the link between nature and human health, very few have focused on the urban context, and most have examined almost exclusively cross-sectional research. This review is a first step toward assessing the possibility of causal relationships between nature and health in urban settings. Methods: Through systematic review of published literature, we explored the association between urban green space and human health. Results: We found consistent negative association between urban green space exposure and mortality, heart rate, and violence, and positive association with attention, mood, and physical activity.

87966,Geographical and experimental contexts modulate the effect of warming on top-down control: a meta-analysis,"Cristiano Marino, Nicholas dos Anjos; Romero, Gustavo Quevedo; Farjalla, Vinicius Fortes",2018,"Ecologists have extensively investigated the effect of warming on consumer-resource interactions, with experiments revealing that warming can strengthen, weaken or have no net effect on top-down control of resources. These experiments have inspired a body of theoretical work to explain the variation in the effect of warming on top-down control. However, there has been no quantitative attempt to reconcile theory with outcomes from empirical studies. To address the gap between theory and experiment, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the combined effect of experimental warming and top-down control on resource biomass and determined potential sources of variation across experiments. We show that differences in experimental outcomes are related to systematic variation in the geographical distribution of studies. Specifically, warming strengthened top-down control when experiments were conducted in colder regions, but had the opposite effect in warmer regions. Furthermore, we found that differences in the thermoregulation strategy of the consumer and openness of experimental arenas to dispersal can contribute to some deviation from the overall geographical pattern. These results reconcile empirical findings and support the expectation of geographical variation in the response of consumer-resource interactions to warming.",ECOLOGY LETTERS,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12913' target='_blank'>10.1111/ele.12913</a>,"Climate change, consumer–resource interaction, ecological contingency, geographical gradient, meta-analysis, temperature, top-down control",What is the effect of combined climate warming and top-down control by consumers on resource biomass?,2,2,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,3,Evidence Review
87968,The relationship between urban forests and income: A meta-analysis,"Gerrish, Ed; Watkins, Shannon Lea",2018,"Urban trees provide substantial public health and public environmental benefits. However, scholarly works suggest that urban trees may be disproportionately low in poor and minority urban communities, meaning that these communities are potentially being deprived of public environmental benefits, a form of environmental injustice. The evidence of this problem is not uniform however, and evidence of inequity varies in size and significance across studies. This variation in results suggests the need for a research synthesis and meta-analysis. We employed a systematic literature search to identify original studies which examined the relationship between urban forest cover and income (n = 61) and coded each effect size (n = 332). We used meta-analytic techniques to estimate the average (unconditional) relationship between urban forest cover and income and to estimate the impact that methodological choices, measurement, publication characteristics, and study site characteristics had on the magnitude of that relationship. We leveraged variation in study methodology to evaluate the extent to which results were sensitive to methodological choices often debated in the geographic and environmental justice literature but not yet evaluated in environmental amenities research. We found evidence of income-based inequity in urban forest cover (unconditional mean effect size = 0.098; s.e. = 0.017) that was robust across most measurement and methodological strategies in original studies. and results did not differ systematically with study site characteristics.

A systematic review,"Laverick, Jack H.; Piango, Shanice; Andradi-Brown, Dominic A.; Exton, Dan A.; Bongaerts, Pim; Bridge, Tom C. L.; Lesser, Michael P.; Pyle, Richard L.; Slattery, Marc; Wagner, Daniel; Rogers, Alex D.",2018,"Background: Globally, shallow-water coral reef biodiversity is at risk from a variety of threats, some of which may attenuate with depth. Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs), occurring from 30 to 40 m and deeper in tropical locations, have been subject to a surge of research this century. Though a number of valuable narrative reviews exist, a systematic quantitative synthesis of published MCE studies is lacking. We conducted a systematic review to collate mesophotic research, including studies from the twentieth century to the present. We highlight current biases in research effort, regarding locations and subject matter, and suggest where more attention may be particularly valuable. Following a notable number of studies considering the potential for mesophotic reefs to act as refuges, it is important to know how comprehensive these sources of recruits and organisms capable of moving to shallow water reefs may be. Methods: We search seven sources of bibliographic data with two search strings, as well as personal libraries. Articles were included if they contained species presence data from both shallower and deeper than 30 m depth on tropical coral reefs. Studies were critically appraised based on the number of species identified and balanced sampling effort with depth. Maximum and minimum depths per species were extracted from each study, along with study region and taxon. We quantified the degree of community overlap between shallow tropical reefs (<30 m) and reefs surveyed at the same locations below 30 m. Proportions of shallow species, across all studied taxa, observed deeper than 30 m were used to generate log odds ratios and passed to a mixed-effects model. Study location and taxon were included as effect modifiers. Funnel plots, regression tests, fail safe numbers, and analysis of a high validity subgroup contributed to sensitivity analyses and tests of bias. Results: Across all studies synthesised we found two-thirds of shallow species were present on mesophotic reefs. Further analysis by taxon and broad locations show that this pattern is influenced geographically and taxonomically. Community overlap was estimated as low as 26% and as high as 97% for some cases. Conclusions: There is clear support for the hypothesis that protecting mesophotic reefs will also help to conserve shallow water species. At the same time, it is important to note that this study does not address mesophotic-specialist communities, or the ecological forces which would permit refuge dynamics. As we limit our analysis to species only present above 30 m it is also possible diversity found exclusively deeper than 30 m warrants protection in its own right. Further research into relatively ignored taxa and geographic regions will help improve the design of protected areas in future.",ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1' target='_blank'>10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1</a>,"Depth, Community structure, Biodiversity, Coral reefs, Twilight zone, Refuge",What is the effect of depth on the distribution and abundance of reef species of conservation interest?,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,3,4,3,2,4,4,4,3,Evidence Review
87954,A review of life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of commonly used ex-situ soil treatment technologies,"Amponsah, Nana Y.; Wang, Junye; Zhao, Lian",2018,"GHG emissions are important footprints because of increasing concern over climate change. Remediation methods produces GHGs in varying quantities based on which activities are involved through its entire life cycle and which contaminants are present, often because some contaminants are more difficult to remove from soil than others. Accounting for emissions from all phases of the project requires a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. LCA can help in choosing the best available technology to reduce the environmental burden of the remediation technology or to improve the sustainability of the technology by implementing systematic approaches to ensure that future developments are optimized for environmental performance throughout the life cycle. The primary objective of this paper is to review existing LCA studies that report GHG emissions (CO2-eq) or Global warming potential (GWP) from six ex situ soil remediation technologies (ESRTs), including excavation and disposal, ex-situ thermal desorption, ex-situ soil vapor extraction, ex-situ bioremediation, excavation and incineration, and soil washing, and present the variability in GHG/GWP results and how this data can help in selecting an ex-situ soil remediation technology with a lower global warming potential. A second objective of this study is to compare the GWP levels of ex-situ remediation to the GWP levels of typical in situ remediation methods. Our results showed a large variation in GHG emissions of treated soil from six ESRTs varying from 3.1 x 10(-7) t to 8.2 t CO2-eq/m(3). Incineration had the highest mean GHG emissions (0.7 t CO2-eq/m(3)) and thermal desorption the lowest (0.07 t CO2-eq/m(3)). It was also found that there was a large variation range of GHG emissions from the ex-situ excavation and disposal method soil treatment technologies, varying from 3.1 x 10(-7) t to 8.2 t CO2-eq/m(3) of treated soil. This knowledge provides opportunities to increase sustainability of soil remediation throughout the investigation, design, construction, operation, and monitoring phases of site remediation regardless of the selected cleanup remedy. This shows data on LCA GHGs are useful to assess the impact of different scenarios and management practices on ESRTs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We reviewed the literature for empirical evidence that ecotourism protects forests. Our conclusions are at once both sobering and encouraging. Ecotourism, as it is typically practiced, leads to deforestation. However, when accompanied by conservation mechanisms (e.g. protected area, Payment for Ecosystem Services, monitoring/enforcement), ecotourism can protect forests. Ecotourism sometimes leads to forest regeneration in agrarian landscapes, but trade-offs, for example old-growth deforestation or water pollution, may occur. From a methodological perspective, we found a dearth (only 17) of articles that empirically analyzed ecotourism impacts on forests, and no studies that used counterfactual impact evaluation approaches. We conclude that there is an insufficient evidence base for inferring effects of ecotourism on forests, and we identify research priorities to build knowledge about how, when, and where to implement ecotourism.",CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2018.04.004' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.cosust.2018.04.004</a>,N/A,What are the effects of ecotourism on forests in biodiversity hotspots?,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,Evidence Review

Following an expert focus group on this topic, a systematic search for articles displaying evidence of weeds providing regulating ecosystem services was performed, resulting in 129 articles. The most common service found was pest control and the prevailing mechanism was that weeds provide a suitable habitat for natural enemies. Other articles showed that weeds improved soil nutrient content, soil physical properties and crop pollinator abundance. Weeds were found to provide some important ecosystem services for agriculture, but only a small number of studies presented data on crop yield. Experimental approaches are proposed that can: (i) disentangle the benefits obtained from ecosystem services provisioning from the costs due to weed competition and (ii) quantify the contribution of diverse weed communities in reducing crop competition and in providing ecosystem services. Existing vegetation databases can be used to select weed species with functional traits facilitating ecosystem service provisioning while having a lower competitive capacity.

87960,"Economic, ecological and genetic impacts of marine stock enhancement and sea ranching: A systematic review","Kitada, Shuichi",2018,"Hatchery release is one of the most popular management tools in fisheries, forestry and wild life management, while its negative impacts on wild populations are a global concern. Research and monitoring of its impacts are generally lacking, and the usefulness of hatchery release for fisheries and conservation objectives is unclear. Here, I evaluated positive and negative impacts of worldwide marine stock enhancement and sea ranching programmes in a systematic review associated with meta-analyses with the goal of reducing bias of the review. Vast numbers of individuals of more than 180 species are released into the wild each year, but most studies are at experimental stages to assess its potential, and empirical studies are sparse for evaluating the impact on fishery production. Most cases are economically unprofitable except for a few successful cases or unevaluated. The effects of releasing juveniles can be dwarfed by the magnitude of natural recruitment when the spawning stock produces much larger recruitment than released juveniles. Density-dependent growth caused by competition of food can be substantial, and growth rates of hatchery and wild fish and other competitive species can simultaneously be reduced when stocking exceeded the carrying capacity. Relative reproductive success can vary depending on the species, seed quality and environmental factors. Empirical studies show evidence of substantial gene flow from hatcheries, but fitness reduction in stocked populations has not been reported. The results represent the current state of worldwide marine stock enhancement and sea ranching activity and provide key information for growing fields of artificial propagation and conservation.",FISH AND FISHERIES,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.12271' target='_blank'>10.1111/faf.12271</a>,"density-dependent growth, fitness, genetic diversity, hatcheries",What are the effects of marine stock enhancement and sea ranching on ecology and genetics of fish communities?,2,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,Evidence Review
87947,How does roadside vegetation management affect the diversity of vascular plants and invertebrates? A systematic review,"Jakobsson, Simon; Bernes, Claes; Bullock, James M.; Verheyen, Kris; Lindborg, Regina",2018,"Background: With appropriate management, based on vegetation removal that reverses late-successional vegetation stages, roadsides can support high levels of biodiversity. However, current recommendations for roadside management to conserve or restore biodiversity are largely based on research on non-roadside grassland habitats, and much of the evidence on how roadside management practices affect biodiversity is found in non-peer-reviewed grey literature. Therefore, based on suggestions from key stakeholders and an initial systematic map that identified 97 studies on how biodiversity is affected by vegetation removal on roadsides, we conducted a full systematic review of the effects on plant and invertebrate diversity of disturbance-based maintenance of roadsides. Methods: The review was restricted to effects of non-chemical interventions such as mowing, burning, grazing and mechanical shrub removal. Studies were selected from the systematic map and from an updated search for more recent literature using a priori eligibility criteria. Relevant articles were subject to critical appraisal of clarity and susceptibility to bias, and studies with low or unclear validity were excluded from the review. Data on species richness, species diversity and abundance of functional groups were extracted together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect modifiers. Results from the 54 included studies were summarised in a narrative synthesis, and impacts of mowing practices on the total species richness and diversity of plants and on the abundance of forbs, graminoids and woody plants were quantitatively analysed using t tests of study-level effect ratios. Results: Nearly all of the 54 studies included in the review were conducted in Europe (29) or North America (24). The vast majority of studies (48) examined impacts of mowing. Effects on vascular plants were reported in 51 studies, whereas 8 of the studies reported on invertebrates. Quantitative analysis of plant species richness and species diversity showed that mowing effects were dependent on the interplay between mowing frequency and hay removal. Thus, there were no statistically significant overall effects of mowing vs. no mowing, frequency of mowing, timing of mowing or hay removal. However, species richness was higher in roadsides mowed once or twice per year with hay removal than in unmown roadsides, and positively affected by mowing twice compared to once per year. Similar, but less pronounced, effects were found for plant species diversity. In addition, mowing had a negative impact on woody plant abundance, and increased mowing frequency had a negative impact on graminoid abundance. The few studies on invertebrates showed effects that diverged across taxon groups, and there was not enough data for quantitative analysis of these results. Conclusions: The results provide evidence on the effects of mowing on plant species richness. To increase plant species richness, roadsides should be mowed each year, preferably twice per year, and hay should be removed after each cutting. The review also identifies large knowledge gaps concerning roadside management and its effects on biodiversity, especially regarding invertebrates. Hence, this systematic review provides not only a valuable basis for evidence-based management but also guidance for future research on this topic, essential to inform management of road networks for biodiversity conservation.",ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-018-0129-z' target='_blank'>10.1186/s13750-018-0129-z</a>,"Biodiversity, Burning, Grazing, Invertebrates, Mowing, Species diversity, Species richness, Vegetation removal",What are the effects of roadside vegetation management on the diversity of vascular plants and invertebrates?,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,4,4,2,4,3,2,4,Evidence Review
87949,Spotted Owls and forest fire: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence,"Lee, Derek E.",2018,"Forest and Spotted Owl management documents often state that severe wildfire is a cause of recent declines in populations of Spotted Owls and that mixed-severity fires (5-70% of burned area in high severity patches with >75% mortality of dominant vegetation) pose a primary threat to Spotted Owl population viability. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarize all available scientific literature on the effects of wildfire on Spotted Owl demography and ecology from studies using empirical data to answer the question: How does fire, especially recent mixed-severity fires with representative patches of high-severity burn within their home ranges, affect Spotted Owl foraging habitat selection, demography, and site occupancy parameters? Fifteen papers reported 50 effects from fire that could be differentiated from post-fire logging. Meta-analysis of mean standardized effects (I ledge's d) found only one parameter was significantly different from zero, a significant positive foraging habitat selection for low-severity burned forest. Multi-level mixed effects meta-regressions (hierarchical models) of I ledge's d against percent of study area burned at high severity and time since fire found the following: a negative correlation of occupancy with time since fire; a positive effect on recruitment immediately after the fire, with the effect diminishing with time since fire; reproduction was positively correlated with the percent of high-severity fire in owl territories; and positive selection for foraging in low- and moderate-severity burned forest, with high-severity burned forest used in proportion to its availability, but not avoided. Meta-analysis of variation found significantly greater variation in parameters from burned sites relative to unburned, with specifically higher variation in estimates of occupancy demography, and survival, and lower variation in estimates of selection probability for foraging habitat in low-severity burned forest. Spotted Owls were usually not significantly affected by mixed-severity fire, as 83% of all studies and 60% of all effects found no significant impact of fire on mean owl parameters. Contrary to current perceptions and recovery efforts for the Spotted Owl, mixed-severity fire does not appear to be a serious threat to owl populations; rather, wildfire has arguably more benefits than costs for Spotted Owls.",ECOSPHERE,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2354' target='_blank'>10.1002/ecs2.2354</a>,"adaptive management, evidence-based decision making, meta-analysis, mixed-severity fire, Spotted Owls, Strix occidentalis, systematic review, wildfire",What are the effects of wildfire on Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) demography and ecology?,4,2,4,3,2,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,Evidence Review

Small rivers in agricultural landscapes are especially exposed to excessive technical actions implemented in order to allow for harvesting river water for irrigation, draining agricultural water and receiving sewage. Regular dredging and macrophyte removal strongly interfere with the global need for preserving river biodiversity that allows agricultural lowland rivers to remain refuges for a variety of species, and-accordingly-to keep water bodies resilient for the benefit of society. In order to provide a comprehensive look at the influence of agricultural lowland river management on the ecological status of these water bodies, we conducted a literature review and a meta-analysis. For the structured literature review we selected 203 papers reflecting on the response of aquatic ecosystems to dredging and macrophyte management actions. The database of scientific contributions developed for our study consists of papers written by the authors from 33 countries (first authorship) addressing dredging, macrophyte removal, status of fish and macroinvertebrates as well as the general ecological status of lowland agricultural rivers. We revealed that 96% of the analyzed papers indicated unilateral, negative responses of aquatic ecosystems, particularly macroinvertebrates, ichthyofauna and macrophyte composition, to maintenance measures. We revealed that studies conducted in the European Union on the ecological status of rivers appeared to significantly increase in quantity after the implementation of the Water Framework Directive.

Given this gap, a systematic review was conducted by assessing major disciplines, geographic distributions, methods and reported energy-saving performances for cooling and heating residential homes. An overwhelming majority of literature focused on single family housing types in North America, with a strong geographic concentration in California. In North America, 40 peer-reviewed studies were published from 1979 to 2017 by 19 different journals across disciplines. Researchers used simulation modeling and empirical approaches in roughly equal proportions. The review confirms that the conceptual and empirical evidence to support trees' energy saving effects is solid, especially for cooling effects, but the magnitude of reported energysavings widely varied depending on climate, method, data and assumptions for buildings and trees. A building with trees used 2.3% to 90% less cooling energy, mostly through shading effects, and 1% to 20% less heating energy through windbreak effects, in comparison to buildings without trees. Takeaways for evidence-based urban greening are that practitioners and researchers should: i) pay careful attention to different methods and assumptions used when interpreting and comparing research findings ii) pursue long-term monitoring and evidence-based management to enhance tree survival and growth; iii) incorporate emerging trade-offs and synergies such as rooftop solar energy, water conservation, and net carbon savings into design and policies; and iv) prioritize planting for underserved and vulnerable communities.",URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.07.021' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.ufug.2018.07.021</a>,"Energy use, residential, shade trees, vegetation, cooling, heating, evidence-based design, urban ecosystem, tree planting",What is the effect of trees and surrounding vegetation on residential energy use?,3,1,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,2,1,1,2,Evidence Review

However, although urban agriculture is also often cited as promoting biodiversity in urban areas, the extent of empirical evidence for such claims has not been studied. Here we systematically review the relationship between urban agriculture and biodiversity in the scientific literature. We strictly define urban agriculture as areas in cities that grow produce specifically for human consumption. We examined 148 papers from 2000 to 2017, of which only 24 studies fit our definition of urban agriculture, and of those, only 18 both involved urban agriculture and measured biodiversity. Of the studies that did measure biodiversity, some showed increases in diversity compared to urban vacant lots, but other showed no difference. Moreover, these studies were mostly focused on plants and invertebrates and were conducted almost exclusively in North America. In order to use the generalization that urban agriculture will have a positive influence on urban biodiversity, more studies will need to be conducted across a wider geographic range worldwide (particularly in developing countries in the tropics) and on a greater diversity of species and taxa (e.g., herpetiles, birds and small mammals).

W.",2018,"In recent years, rising competition for water coupled with new environmental regulations has exerted pressure on water allocations for turfgrass irrigation. In this article, we reviewed published scientific and industry evidence on the agronomic and environmental impacts of turfgrass irrigation using a robust systematic review methodology. Our focus was on the links between (i) irrigation management (amount and frequency), (ii) agronomic responses to irrigation (turf quality, growth rates and rooting) and (iii) environmental impacts (nitrogen leaching). Based on an initial screening of 653 studies and data extracted from 83 papers, our results show that in most cases, under moderate levels of deficit irrigation (50%-60% of actual evapotranspiration), turf quality can be maintained at an acceptable level but with lower water consumption compared to irrigating back to field capacity. Irrigation beyond field capacity was found to increase the risk of nutrient leaching. However, evidence also showed that the concentration and total loss of NO3-in leachate were influenced more by nitrogen (N) rates, soil characteristics, turfgrass species and turfgrass growth rates than by irrigation practices. Our analyses suggest that turfgrass irrigation should be scheduled to apply water at moderate levels of deficit irrigation, sufficient to maintain turfgrass quality but limited to promote a deep and extensive rooting system.

A systematic review","Eales, Jacqualyn; Haddaway, Neal R.; Bernes, Claes; Cooke, Steven J.; Jonsson, Bengt Gunnar; Kouki, Jari; Petrokofsky, Gillian; Taylor, Jessica J.",2018,"Background: While the effects of prescribed burning on tree regeneration and on pyrophilous and/or saproxylic species are relatively well known, effects on other organisms are less clear. The primary aim of this systematic review was to clarify how biodiversity is affected by prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forests, and whether burning may be useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity, beyond that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Methods: The review examined primary field studies of the effects of prescribed burning on biodiversity in boreal and temperate forests in protected areas or under commercial management. Non-intervention or alternate levels of intervention were comparators. Relevant outcomes were species richness and diversity, excluding that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Relevant studies were extracted from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active management in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. Additional searches and a search update were undertaken using a strategy targeted to identify studies focused on prescribed burning interventions. Grey literature and bibliographies of relevant published reviews were also searched for evidence. Studies were assessed for internal and external validity and data were extracted, using validity assessment and data extraction tools specifically designed for this review. Studies were presented in a narrative synthesis and interactive map, and those which were suitable were quantitatively synthesised using meta-analyses, subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: Searches generated a total of 12,971 unique records. After screening for relevance, 244 studies (from 235 articles) were included in this review. Most studied forests were located in the USA (172/244), with the rest located in Canada, Europe and Australia. Eighty-two studies reporting 219 comparisons were included in the quantitative synthesis. Within the meta-analyses for each group of taxa, we identified a small to moderate volume of evidence, and heterogeneity was ubiquitous. Prescribed burning had significant positive effects on vascular plant richness, non-native vascular plant richness, and in broadleaf forests, herbaceous plant richness. Time since the burn, forest type and climate zone were significant moderators predicting the effect of burning on herbaceous plant richness. No other significant relationships were identified. Conclusions: Knowledge gaps exist for studies outside North America, in mixed forests and for non-plant organism outcomes. We identify a need to apply study designs consistently and appropriately, minimising the impact of confounding factors wherever possible, and to provide extensive detail in study reports. We recommend that researchers build long-term datasets charting the impacts of prescribed burning on succession. The lack of consistent findings was likely due to high inter-study heterogeneity, and low numbers of comparable studies in each quantitative synthesis. We found no consistent effects of moderators, and were unable to test the effect of many potential moderators, due to a lack of reporting. Rather than making any general recommendations on the use of prescribed burning for biodiversity restoration, we provide an evidence atlas of previous studies for researchers and practitioners to use. We observe that outcomes are still difficult to predict, and any restoration project should include a component of monitoring to build a stronger evidence base for recommendations and guidelines on how to best achieve conservation targets.

Although much evidence suggests greenspace exposure is beneficial for health, there exists no systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesise and quantify the impact of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes. Objective: To quantify evidence of the impact of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes. Methods: We searched five online databases and reference lists up to January 2017. Studies satisfying a priori eligibility criteria were evaluated independently by two authors. Results: We included 103 observational and 40 interventional studies investigating similar to 100 health outcomes. Meta-analysis results showed increased greenspace exposure was associated with decreased salivary cortisol -0.05 (95% CI -0.07, -0.04), heart rate -2.57 (95% CI -4.30, -0.83), diastolic blood pressure -1.97 (95% CI -3.45, -0.19), HDL cholesterol -0.03 (95% CI -0.05, < -0.01), low frequency heart rate variability_(HRV)_-0.06 (95% CI -0.08, -0.03) and increased high frequency HRV 91.87 (95% CI 50.92, 132.82), as well as decreased risk of preterm birth 0.87 (95% CI 0.80, 0.94), type II diabetes 0.72 (95% CI 0.61, 0.85), all-cause mortality 0.69 (95% CI 0.55, 0.87), small size for gestational age 0.81 (95% CI 0.76, 0.86), cardiovascular mortality 0.84 (95% CI 0.76, 0.93), and an increased incidence of good self-reported health 1.12 (95% CI 1.05, 1.19). Incidence of stroke, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, asthma, and coronary heart disease were reduced. For several non-pooled health outcomes, between 66.7% and 100% of studies showed health-denoting associations with increased greenspace exposure including neurological and cancer-related outcomes, and respiratory mortality. Conclusions: Greenspace exposure is associated with numerous health benefits in intervention and observational studies. These results are indicative of a beneficial influence of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes. However several meta-analyses results are limited by poor study quality and high levels of heterogeneity. Green prescriptions involving greenspace use may have substantial benefits.

Ignacio; Jansen, Patrick A.; Poorter, Lourens",2018,"Wild ungulates such as red deer, roe deer and wild boar are key drivers of forest ecosystems. Across the northern hemisphere, their range and abundance is increasing, while at the same time forest conversion and habitat fragmentation have led to a large variation in ungulate density and composition among areas. Understanding ungulate density impacts are important in order to prevent shifts towards undesired states, such as from forest to heathland. Here, we assess the effects of ungulate density on forest regeneration, development and functioning. We carried out a systematic literature review of 433 published studies in temperate forests, and used the data to model dose-response curves of the effects of ungulate density on three sets of forest attributes; tree regeneration (abundance, species richness and composition), forest structure (horizontal and vertical), and forest functioning (nutrient cycling in soil, timber and food production). Ungulate density averaged 23.6 km(-2) across studies. Ungulates had a negative effect on forest regeneration, structure and functioning in 70% of the evaluated cases. The dose-response curves had a sigmoidal, rather than a unimodal shape. Critical tipping points, where ungulates started to have a negative effect on forest regeneration, were found at an ungulate metabolic weight density of 115 kg km(-2) for forest regeneration, 141 kg km(-2) for forest structure, and 251 kg km(-2) for forest functioning, which is roughly equivalent to 10, 13 and 23 roe deer per km(-2). Forest regeneration was most sensitive to immediate browsing and trampling impacts of small seedlings, while forest functioning was least sensitive because of time lags. However, these effects may build up over time.

87928,The relationship between greenspace and the mental wellbeing of adults: A systematic review,"Houlden, Victoria; Weich, Scott; de Albuquerque, Joao Porto; Jarvis, Stephen; Rees, Karen",2018,"Introduction The view that interacting with nature enhances mental wellbeing is commonplace, despite a dearth of evidence or even agreed definitions of `nature'. The aim of this review was to systematically appraise the evidence for associations between greenspace and mental wellbeing, stratified by the different ways in which greenspace has been conceptualised in quantitative research. Methods We undertook a comprehensive database search and thorough screening of articles which included a measure of greenspace and validated mental wellbeing tool, to capture aspects of hedonic and/or eudaimonic wellbeing. Quality and risk of bias in research were assessed to create grades of evidence. We undertook detailed narrative synthesis of the 50 studies which met the review inclusion criteria, as methodological heterogeneity precluded metaanalysis. Results Results of a quality assessment and narrative synthesis suggest associations between different greenspace characteristics and mental wellbeing. We identified six ways in which greenspace was conceptualised and measured: (i) amount of local-area greenspace; (ii) greenspace type; (iii) visits to greenspace; (iv) views of greenspace; (v) greenspace accessibility; and (vi) self-reported connection to nature. There was adequate evidence for associations between the amount of local-area greenspace and life satisfaction (hedonic wellbeing), but not personal flourishing (eudaimonic wellbeing). Evidence for associations between mental wellbeing and visits to greenspace, accessibility, and types of greenspace was limited. There was inadequate evidence for associations with views of greenspace and connectedness to nature. Several studies reported variation in associations between greenspace and wellbeing by life course stage, gender, levels of physically activity or attitudes to nature. Conclusions Greenspace has positive associations with mental wellbeing (particularly hedonic wellbeing), but the evidence is not currently sufficient or specific enough to guide planning decisions. Further studies are needed, based on dynamic measures of greenspace, reflecting access and uses of greenspace, and measures of both eudaimonic and hedonic mental wellbeing.",PLOS ONE,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203000' target='_blank'>10.1371/journal.pone.0203000</a>,,What is the effect of exposure to greenspace on adult human wellbeing?,3,3,4,2,4,1,2,4,1,2,2,2,4,1,2,3,Evidence Review
87916,Factors affecting biodiversity in agrosylvopastoral ecosystems with in the Mediterranean Basin: A systematic review,"Plexida, S.; Solomou, A.; Poirazidis, K.; Sfougaris, A.",2018,"The biodiversity of Mediterranean agrosylvopastoral ecosystems has been extensively studied, because the Mediterranean Basin is a crossroad of biogeographical influences between cold temperate biota and subtropical species. Here, we systematically reviewed biodiversity studies published on natural and managed agrosylvopastoral ecosystems between 2000 and 2013 to obtain information on animal and plant species richness and diversity and the factors that affect biodiversity. Overall, 774 studies of potential relevance were identified, of which 230 provided information on biological monitoring and 154 met the requirements for the systematic review. Most articles were published in 2004, 2007, and 2011, and most were conducted in Spain. There was sufficient data on species richness to perform a meta-analysis comparing the species richness of 18 different terrestrial ecosystems containing seven taxonomic groups: plants, birds, invertebrates, reptiles, fungi, mammals, and amphibians. Ecosystem type, experimental design, number of study sites, habitat characteristics, and landscape structure were the most frequently mentioned factors affecting biodiversity. Plants were primarily analyzed (42.9% of reviewed studies), with patches and plots being the most common experimental design (64.8%). In comparison, amphibians were the least studied group (1.7%), with transects being the least used experimental design (11.1%). Plants had the highest average species richness (128.25) in managed woodlands, while birds had the lowest (18), with invertebrates generally representing good indicators of biodiversity. Overall, our review indicates that habitat heterogeneity is of importance for safeguarding species adapted to the variety of microhabitats, with it being important to implement traditional cultivation and grazing practices when managing these areas (such as the maintenance of the agro-forestry systems). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Journal of Arid Environments,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.11.017

For instance, the degree of fear perceived by fishes targeted by fisheries is frequently higher in unprotected marine areas than in areas where some protection is provided. We systematically reviewed the literature on how fear, which we define as variation in escape behavior, was quantified in reef fishes. In the past 25 years, a total of 33 studies were identified, many of which were published within the last five years and nearly 40% of those (n = 13) focused on Indo-Pacific reefs, showing that there are still many geographical gaps. While eleven escape metrics were identified to evaluate fish escape, flight initiation distance (FID) was the most commonly employed (n = 23). FID was used to study different questions of applied and theoretical ecology, which involved 14 reef fish families. We also used a formal meta-analysis to investigate the effects of fishing by comparing FID inside and outside marine protected areas. Fishes outside MPAs had increased FID compared to those inside MPAs. The Labridae family had a significantly higher effect sizes than Acanthuridae and Epinephelidae, suggesting that fishes in this family may be indicators of effective MPAs using FID. We conclude that protocols aimed to quantify fear in fishes, which provide accurate assessments of fishing effects on fish escape behavior, will help gauge the compliance of marine protected areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Marine Environmental Research,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.02.011

87911,A systematic review of management efforts on goatgrass (Aegilops spp) dominance,"Gornish, E.S.; Case, E.; Valle, M.; Bean, T.M.; Moore-O’Leary, K.A.",2018,"Goatgrass (Aegilops) species are some of the most aggressive invasive plants in the Western U.S. Despite intense management efforts, goatgrass continues to reduce the ecological and economic integrity of natural and agroecological systems. The mismatch between current research outcomes and practical needs of land managers is likely a result of limitations associated with generalizing from single location, treatment, or season studies. We conducted a systematic review of experiments testing control of two dominant goatgrass invaders (A. cylindrica and A. triuncialis) to identify general patterns in treatment efficiency. Using data from 391 separate experiments, we found that experimental treatments were more successful at controlling the dominance of A. cylindrica compared to A. triuncialis. For A. cylindrica, no treatment demonstrated particular utility for control. Treatment of A. cylindrica in the vegetative stage was more effective for control than treatment at other stages. For A. triuncialis, burning and grazing demonstrated effective overall control among all treatments, although grazing produced variable results. Treatment in the fruiting stage of A. triuncialis was more effective for control than treatment at other stages. For both species, multiple applications of a management treatment within a year resulted in no better control than a single application within a year. Additionally, treatments deployed in two consecutive years resulted in better control of both species, than a treatment deployed in a single year. This work highlights promising avenues for more intensive research on goatgrass weed control and suggests that management funding is most effectively utilized when employed across years rather than focused on a single year. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Plant Ecology,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-018-0817-3

A systematic review,"Bernes, C.; Macura, B.; Jonsson, B.G.; Junninen, K.; Müller, J.; Sandström, J.; Lõhmus, A.; Macdonald, E.",2018,"Background: Livestock grazing and 'overabundance' of large wild herbivores in forested areas have long been perceived as conflicting with the aims of both silviculture and forest conservation; however, certain kinds of herbivory can help to maintain habitat values in forest ecosystems. Management of mammalian herbivory in protected forests can, therefore, be a critical tool for biodiversity conservation. The primary aim of this systematic review was to examine how forest vegetation and invertebrates are affected by manipulation of the grazing/browsing pressure by livestock or wild ungulates. The ultimate purpose was to investigate whether such manipulation is useful for conserving or restoring biodiversity in forest set-asides. Methods: We considered studies of manipulated ungulate herbivory in forests anywhere within the boreal and temperate zones, not only in protected areas but also in production forest. Non-intervention or alternative levels of intervention were used as comparators. Relevant outcomes included abundance, diversity and composition of plants and invertebrates, tree regeneration, and performance of focal/target species. Studies were mainly selected from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity effects of forest management relevant to protected areas. Additional studies were identified through updated searches online and in bibliographies of existing reviews. Relevant studies were critically appraised, and studies with low or unclear validity were excluded from the review. Quantitative outcomes were extracted from 103 articles, and summary effect sizes were derived by meta-analysis. Results: Most of the 144 studies included in the review had been conducted in North America, Europe or Australia/New Zealand. The intervention most commonly studied was experimental exclusion (or enclosure) of wild and/or domestic ungulates by fencing. Other studies examined culling of wild ungulates or compared forests long grazed by livestock to ungrazed forests. Effects on vegetation and invertebrates were reported in 135 and 23 of the studies, respectively. We found negative responses to herbivory in the abundance of understorey vegetation as a whole, woody understorey and bryophytes, and also in the species richness of woody understorey vegetation, whereas the richness of forbs and bryophytes responded positively. Several effects depended on ungulate origins: Understorey abundance responded negatively to livestock and to ungulates introduced into the wild, but not to native ones. In contrast, understorey species richness responded positively to livestock but not to wild ungulates. The duration and intensity of herbivory had few significant effects on vegetation - exceptions included woody understorey abundance and richness, which decreased with increasing duration and intensity, respectively. Among invertebrates we found negative responses to herbivory in the abundance of lepidopterans and spiders, but no significant effects on species richness. Conclusions: Our review revealed a large body of high-validity experimental studies on impacts of ungulate herbivory in forests. This evidence confirmed that manipulation of such herbivory is often highly influential on tree regeneration and on the abundance, diversity and composition of understorey vegetation. Nevertheless, we also identified important knowledge gaps - we found few studies of boreal areas, long-term herbivory effects, impacts on bryophytes, lichens and invertebrates, and effects of manipulation less radical than total exclusion of ungulates. © 2018 The Author(s).",Environmental Evidence,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-018-0125-3

They are expected to have extensive ecological impacts by altering the physical–chemical structure of ecosystems, thereby changing the rules of existence for a broad range of resident biota. To test the generality of this expectation, we used a global systematic review and meta-analysis to examine IEE effects on the abundance of individual species and communities, biodiversity (using several indices) and ecosystem functions, focusing on marine and estuarine environments. We found that IEE had a significant effect (positive and negative) in most studies testing impacts on individual species, but the overall (cumulative) effect size was small and negative. Many individual studies showed strong IEE effects on community abundance and diversity, but the direction of effects was variable, leading to statistically non-significant overall effects in most categories. In contrast, there was a strong overall effect on most ecosystem functions we examined. IEE negatively affected metabolic functions and primary production, but positively affected nutrient flux, sedimentation and decomposition. We use the results to develop a conceptual model by highlighting pathways whereby IEE impact communities and ecosystem functions, and identify several sources of research bias in the IEE-related invasion literature. Only a few of the studies simultaneously quantified IEE effects on community/diversity and ecosystem functions. Therefore, understanding how IEE may alter biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships should be a primary focus of future studies of invasion biology. Moreover, the clear effects of IEE on ecosystem functions detected in our study suggest that scientists and environmental managers ought to examine how the effects of IEE might be manifested in the services that marine ecosystems provide to humans. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Global Change Biology,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14007

87892,Tillage intensity affects total SOC stocks in boreo-temperate regions only in the topsoil—A systematic review using an ESM approach,"Meurer, K.H.E.; Haddaway, N.R.; Bolinder, M.A.; Kätterer, T.",2018,"Shifting from high intensity (HT) to intermediate intensity (IT) or no tillage (NT) practices has been credited as being a promising agricultural management option towards climate change mitigation due to carbon (C) sequestration in the soil. The consequences of conversion from HT to mainly NT on soil organic carbon (SOC) have been subject to a number of meta-analyses revealing either a positive or non-significant effect. In this study, we used the equivalent soil mass (ESM) approach to evaluate SOC stock changes following the conversion from HT to IT and NT considering studies compiled within a systematic review. In order to maximize the use of available evidence, we used different substitution methods for imputing missing information on the variance of both SOC and bulk density (ρb). Based on a total of 101 long-term field trials (&gt; 10 years), the positive effect of IT and NT compared to HT was found to be limited to the topsoil (0–30 cm depth). Estimated SOC stock increases for this particular depth ranged from 3.22 ± 1.48 to 3.50 ± 1.60 (HT vs. IT) and 4.19 ± 1.82 to 4.23 ± 1.92 Mg ha− 1 (HT vs. NT). Calculating stocks based on fixed depth layers and without consideration of the equivalent soil mass, respectively, resulted in an overestimation of the increase with 15 (HT vs. IT) and 47% (HT vs. NT and IT vs. NT). Due to shallow sampling depth, HT vs. IT and IT vs. NT comparisons were limited to 0–30 cm depth, but the effect of HT to NT conversion could also be determined for 0–60 cm. The results indicate that the NT sequestration potential is overvalued when neglecting deeper depths, since the SOC storage capacity was reduced to &lt; 0.10 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1. No linear relation between relative SOC stock changes and climate, soil, and cropping systems was found. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Earth-Science Reviews,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.12.015

ZnO NPs are inevitably released in the environment during the production, transport, use and disposal process. Therefore, it is necessary to understand their toxicities and mode of actions. This review summarizes the toxic effects of ZnO NPs with different properties and exposed conditions on different species. The mechanisms of ZnO NPs on living organisms could be mainly attributed to one or more of the following aspects: the physical damage of direct contact, the dissolved zinc ions and the ROS-mediated mechanism. This paper systematically reviews the toxic effects of ZnO NPs on organisms and puts forward the existing problems, which are helpful for the safe and efficient use of ZnO NPs, providing the basis for further study of the toxic effects of ZnO NPs and establishing a comprehensive and safe evaluation system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Chemosphere,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.077

87889,What is the effect of phasing out long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their precursors in the environment? A systematic review,"Land, M.; De Wit, C.A.; Bignert, A.; Cousins, I.T.; Herzke, D.; Johansson, J.H.; Martin, J.W.",2018,"Background: There is a concern that continued emissions of man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental and human health effects. Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis. Results: Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9-14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend. Conclusions: For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe. © 2018 The Author(s).",Environmental Evidence,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y

Based on stoichiometric principles, soil microbial processes are expected to be limited by mineral nutrients, which are particularly scarce in often highly weathered tropical forest soils. Such limitation is directly relevant for the fate of soil carbon and global element cycles, but its extent and nature have never been assessed systematically across the tropical biome. Here, we address the relative importance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients in limiting soil microbial biomass and process rates in tropical forests. We conducted an in-depth literature review and a meta-analysis of the available nutrient addition experiments in tropical forests worldwide. Our synthesis showed predominant and general phosphorus limitation of a variety of microbial processes across tropical forests, and additional nitrogen limitation in tropical montane forests. The apparent widespread microbial phosphorus limitation needs to be accounted for in the understanding and prediction of biogeochemical cycles in tropical forests and their future functioning. Other mineral nutrients or carbon may modify the importance of phosphorus, but more experimental studies are urgently needed. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America",Ecological Monographs,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1279

87866,The Different Dimensions of Livelihood Impacts of Payments for Environmental Services (PES) Schemes: A Systematic Review,"Blundo-Canto, G.; Bax, V.; Quintero, M.; Cruz-Garcia, G.S.; Groeneveld, R.A.; Perez-Marulanda, L.",2018,"Through a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature, this paper analyzes evidence of the livelihood impacts of Payments for Environmental Services (PES). Forty-six studies assessed PES livelihood impacts. The assessments presented more positive livelihood impacts than negative ones, focusing on financial benefits. Non-monetary and non-material impacts of PES were largely understudied. Most reviews focused on ES providers, hindering the understanding of broader societal impacts. The review yielded examples where participants lost from their participation or where improvements in one livelihood dimension paralleled deterioration in another. Consequently, we identified key research gaps in: i) understanding the social and cultural impacts of PES, ii) evaluating environmental and economic additionality from improving other ES at the expense of cultural ones, iii) and assessing PES impacts in terms of trade-offs between multiple livelihood dimensions. Moreover, increased knowledge is needed on the impact of PES on changes in household expenditure and choice, and on trade-offs between household income and inequality in ES provider communities. Finally, if PES schemes are implemented to sustainably improve livelihoods, targeting disaggregated populations, understanding equity and social power relations within and between ES providers and users, and better monitoring and evaluation systems that consider locally relevant livelihood dimensions are needed.",Ecological Economics,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.03.011

87846,Performance of green supply chain management: A systematic review and meta analysis,"Fang, Chencheng; Zhang, Jiantong",2018,"Environmental sustainability is nowadays driving firms to not only develop internal green activities, but also extend toward green supply chain management (GSCM). The extensive application of external GSCM by firms can be partially justified from perspective of transaction costs. GSCM practices are often considered to be prudent because studies suggested that such practices have a positive impact on firm performance according to the resource-based view. However, crucial questions still surround the practice-performance relationship. First, what is the overall relationship between GSCM practice and firm performance? Second, under what situations is the relationship stronger or weaker? To answer these questions, this paper focuses on quantitatively analyzing extant literature published in the field of GSCM. A random-effects meta-analysis is used to synthesize the empirical results of 54 selected literature with 245 effect sizes. Besides, subgroup analysis and meta-regression are applied to test potential moderators that may influence the strength of practice-performance relationship. We find that, internal and external GSCM practices are positively related, and they are both positively related to firm performance. Particularly, their relationship with environmental (r = 0.518) performance is the largest, followed by operational (r = 0.481) and economic (r = 0.464) performance. In addition, test of moderators discovers that industry type, ISO certification, export orientation and the cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance all have moderating effect on the practice-performance relationship. Discussions and limitations are further addressed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.171

87848,Effects of desiccation stress on adult female longevity in Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae): results of a systematic review and pooled survival analysis,"Schmidt, Chris A.; Comeau, Genevieve; Monaghan, Andrew J.; Williamson, Daniel J.; Ernst, Kacey C.",2018,"Background: Transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya are affected by the longevity of the adult female mosquito. Environmental conditions influence the survival of adult female Aedes mosquitoes, the primary vectors of these viruses. While the association of temperature with Aedes mortality has been relatively well-explored, the role of humidity is less established. The current study's goals were to compile knowledge of the influence of humidity on adult survival in the important vector species Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, and to quantify this relationship while accounting for the modifying effect of temperature. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review to identify studies reporting experimental results informing the relationships among temperature, humidity and adult survival in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Using a novel simulation approach to harmonize disparate survival data, we conducted pooled survival analyses via stratified and mixed effects Cox regression to estimate temperature-dependent associations between humidity and mortality risk for these species across a broad range of temperatures and vapor pressure deficits. Results: After screening 1517 articles, 17 studies (one in semi-field and 16 in laboratory settings) met inclusion criteria and collectively reported results for 192 survival experiments. We review and synthesize relevant findings from these studies. Our stratified model estimated a strong temperature-dependent association of humidity with mortality in both species, though associations were not significant for Ae. albopictus in the mixed effects model. Lowest mortality risks were estimated around 27.5 degrees C and 21.5 degrees C for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively, and mortality increased non-linearly with decreasing humidity. Aedes aegypti had a survival advantage relative to Ae. albopictus in the stratified model under most conditions, but species differences were not significant in the mixed effects model. Conclusions: Humidity is associated with mortality risk in adult female Ae. aegypti in controlled settings. Data are limited at low humidities, temperature extremes, and for Ae. albopictus, and further studies should be conducted to reduce model uncertainty in these contexts. Desiccation is likely an important factor in Aedes population dynamics and viral transmission in arid regions. Models of Aedes-borne virus transmission may be improved by more comprehensively representing humidity effects.",PARASITES & VECTORS,<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2808-6' target='_blank'>10.1186/s13071-018-2808-6</a>,"Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus , Longevity, Survival, Humidity, Vapor pressure, Temperature, Review, Pooled analysis",What are the effects of desiccation stress on adult female longevity in Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae)?,2,2,4,3,3,3,2,2,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,3,Evidence Review
