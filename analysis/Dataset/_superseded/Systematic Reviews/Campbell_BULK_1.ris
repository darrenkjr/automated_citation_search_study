N2  - Abstract Background Adopted children and children placed in foster care are at increased risk of developing a range of mental health, behavioural, and psychosocial adjustment problems. Previous studies suggest that due to early experiences of separation and loss some children may have difficulties forming a secure attachment relationship with the adoptive/foster parents. Objectives The objectives of the present review were: (1) to assess the efficacy of attachment-based interventions on measures of favourable parent/child outcomes (attachment security, dyadic interaction, parent/child psychosocial adjustment, behavioural and mental health problems, and placement breakdown) within foster and adoptive families with children aged between 0 and 17 years. (2) to identify factors that appear to be associated with more effective outcomes and factors that modify intervention effectiveness (e.g., age of the child at placement and at intervention start, programme duration, programme focus). Search Methods Relevant studies were identified through electronic searches of bibliographic databases, governmental and grey literature repositories, hand search in specific targeted journals, citation tracking, contact to international experts and Internet search engines. The database searches were carried out to October 2020. Selection Criteria The interventions of interest were parenting interventions aimed at helping the foster/adopted children and their parents to form or sustain a secure attachment relationship. The interventions had to be at least partly informed by attachment theory. Data Collection and Analysis The total number of potentially relevant studies constituted 17.822 hits after duplicates were removed. A total of 44 studies (27 different populations) met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised by the review authors. Due to critical study quality, missing numeric data and re-use of the same data, only 24 studies analysing 16 different populations could be used in the data synthesis (children, N?=?1302; parents, N?=?1344). Meta-analysis using both child and parent outcomes were conducted on each metric separately. All analyses were inverse variance weighted using random effects statistical models. Random effects weighted mean effect sizes were calculated using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When possible, we conducted moderator analysis using meta-regression and single factor sub group moderator analysis. Sensitivity analysis were conducted across study design and domains of the risk of bias assessment. Main Results Ten studies analysed the effect of attachment-based interventions on the overall psychosocial adjustment of foster or adopted children as reported by their caregivers post intervention. Measures used include the Child Behaviour Checklist, The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Brief Infant?Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) and Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory. The random effects weighted standardised mean difference (SMD) favouring the intervention group was 0.37 (95% CI, 0.10?0.65) and statistically significant. Three studies analysed the effects of attachment-based interventions on the observed attachment security of foster and adopted children as measured by independent observation. Measures include the Strange Situation Procedure, Attachment Q-Set, and The Emotional Availability Clinical Screener. The random effects weighted SMD was 0.59 (95% CI, ?0.40?1.57) and not statistically significant. Four studies analysed the effect of attachment-based interventions on positive child behaviour post intervention as measured by independent observation of video-taped interaction between the child and caregivers. Measures include Disruptive Behaviour Diagnostic Observation Schedule (DB-DOS) and Emotional Availability Scales). The random effects weighted SMD was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.14?0.64) and statistically significant. Ten studies analysed the effect of attachment-based interventions on positive parenting behaviour post intervention as measured by independent observation of video-taped interaction between the child and caregivers or coding of audio-taped recordings of parental speech. Measures include Adapted Ainsworth Scales for sensitivity and noninterference, Measurement of Empathy in Adult?Child Interaction, The Dyadic Parent?Child Interaction Coding System, Reflective functioning scale, and Emotional Availability Scales. The random effects weighted SMD was 1.56 (95% CI, 0.81?2.31) and statistically significant. Nine studies analysed the effect of attachment-based interventions on self-reported post intervention parenting stress (Parenting Stress Index). The random effects weighted SMD was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.03?0.46.) and statistically significant. Three studies analysed the effect of attachment-based interventions on parental post intervention self-reported depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory). The random effects weighted SMD was 0.59 (95% CI, ?0.08?1.25.) and not statistically significant. Follow-up analyses were carried out for the outcomes externalising behaviour, positive parenting, and parenting stress, but due to the low number of studies, results should be viewed with caution. Results of the single factor sub group moderator analysis suggest that it cannot be ruled out the effects differ depending on whether the interventions take place in the family home or in a clinical setting. However, it is unclear which location is associated with more positive effects as our findings differ between child and parent outcomes. Results of the sensitivity analysis showed no appreciable changes in the results following the removal of any of the studies in any of the analyses. Authors' Conclusions Parenting interventions based on attachment theory increase positive parent/child interactional behaviours, decrease parenting stress, and increase the overall psychosocial adjustment of children in foster and adoptive families postintervention. Due to the low number of studies evidence regarding the effects of attachment-based parenting interventions on attachment security and disorganised attachment in foster and adopted children was inconclusive. Theoretically, it is possible that child attachment security and/or attachment disorganisation cannot change within the relatively short period of time that parenting interventions typically last. It is possible that if postintervention improvements in parenting behaviours are sustained over time, it may lead to possible improvement in child attachment security and a decrease in child disorganised attachment. Thus, more longitudinal research is needed. Furthermore, evidence regarding the long-term effects of attachment-based parenting interventions on any outcomes was inconclusive due to too few studies, but findings suggest that attachment-based interventions increase positive parenting behaviour at follow-up points 3?6 months after the intervention. No study included in the present review provided a measure of placement stability or breakdown as an outcome, which could be used in the meta-analysis. This further emphasises the need for future longitudinal research in prevention of placement breakdown.

N2  - Abstract Background The residential sector releases around 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions and making residential buildings more energy efficient can help mitigate climate change. Engineering models are often used to predict the effects of residential energy efficiency interventions (REEI) on energy consumption, but empirical studies find that these models often over-estimate the actual impact of REEI installation. Different empirical studies often estimate different impacts for the same REEI, possibly due to variations in implementation, climate and population. Funding for this systematic review was provided by the evaluation function at the European Investment Bank Group. Objectives The review aims to assess the effectiveness of installing REEIs on the following primary outcomes: energy consumption, energy affordability, CO2 emissions and air quality indices and pollution levels. Search Methods We searched CAB Abst, Econlit, Greenfile, Repec, Academic Search Complete, WB e-lib, WoS (SCI and SSCI) and other 42 databases in November 2020. In addition, we searched for grey literature on websites, checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews, used Google Scholar to identify studies citing included studies, and contacted the authors of studies for any ongoing and unpublished studies. We retrieved a total of 13,629 studies that we screened at title and abstract level, followed by full-text screening and data extraction. Selection Criteria We included randomised control trials, and quasi-experimental studies that evaluated the impact of installing REEIs anywhere in the world and with any comparison. Data Collection and Analysis Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. When more than one included study examined the same installation of the same type of REEI for a similar outcome, we conducted a meta-analysis. We also performed subgroup analyses. Main Results A total of 16 studies were eligible and included in the review: two studies evaluated the installation of efficient lighting, three studies the installation of attic/loft insulation, two studies the installation of efficient heat pumps, eight studies the installation of a bundle of energy efficiency measures (EEMs), and one study evaluated other EEMs. Two studies, neither appraised as having a low risk of bias, find that lighting interventions lead to a significant reduction in electricity energy consumption (Hedges' g?=??0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ?0.48, ?0.10). All the other interventions involved heating or cooling, and effects were synthesizised by warmer or colder climate and then across climates. Four studies examined the impact of attic/loft insulation on energy consumption, and two of these studies were appraised as having a low risk of bias. Three studies took place in colder climates with gas consumption as an outcome, and one study took place in a warmer climate, with the electricity consumption (air conditioning) as the outcome. The average impact across all climates was small (Hedges' g?=?0.04; 95% CI: ?0.09, 0.01) and statistically insignificant. However, two of the studies appear to have evaluated the effect of installing small amounts (less than 75?mm) of insulation. The other two studies, one of which was appraised as low risk of bias and the other involving air conditioning, found significant reductions in consumption. Two studies examined the impact of installing electric heat pumps. The average impact across studies was not statistically significant (Hedges' g?=??0.11; 95% CI: ?0.41, 0.20). However, there was substantial variation between the two studies. Replacing older pumps with more efficient versions significantly reduced electricity consumption in a colder climate (Hedges' g?=??0.36; 95% CI, ?0.57, ?0.14) in a high risk of bias study. However, a low risk of bias study found a significant increase in electricity consumption from installing new heat pumps (Hedges' g?=?0.09; 95% CI, 0.06, 0.12). Supplemental analyses in the latter study indicate that households also used the heat pumps for cooling and that the installed heat pumps most likely reduced overall energy consumption across all sources?that is, households used more electricity but less gas, wood and coal. Seven studies examined bundled REEIs where the households chose which EEMs to install (in five studies the installation occurred after an energy audit that recommended which EEMs to install). Overall, the studies estimated that installing an REEI bundle is associated with a significant reduction in energy consumption (Hedges' g?=??0.36; 95% CI, ?0.52, ?0.19). In the two low risk of bias studies, conducted with mostly low-income households, installed bundles reduced energy consumption by a statistically significant amount (Hedges' g?=??0.16; 95% CI, ?0.13, ?0.18). Authors' Conclusions The 16 included studies indicate that installing REEIs can significantly reduce energy consumption. However, the same type of REEI installed in different studies caused different effects, indicating that effects are conditional on implementation and context. Exploring causes of this variation is usually not feasible because existing research often does not clearly report the features of installed interventions. Additional high quality impact evaluations should be commissioned in more diverse contexts (only one study was conducted in either Asia or Africa?both involved lighting interventions?and no studies were conducted in South America or Southern Europe).

N2  - Abstract Background The adoption of improved technologies is generally associated with better economic performance and development. Despite its desirable effects, the process of technology adoption can be quite slow and market failures and other frictions may impede adoption. Interventions in market processes may be necessary to promote the adoption of beneficial technologies. This review systematically identifies and summarizes the evidence on the effects of interventions that shape the incentives of firms to adopt new technologies. Following Foster and Rosenzweig, technology is defined as ?the relationship between inputs and outputs,? and technology adoption as ?the use of new mappings between input and outputs and the corresponding allocations of inputs that exploit the new mappings.? The review focuses on studies that include direct evidence on technology adoption, broadly defined, as an outcome. The term intervention refers broadly to sources of exogenous variation that shape firms' incentives to adopt new technologies, including public policies, interventions carried out by private institutions (such as NGOs), experimental manipulations implemented by academic researchers trying to understand technology adoption, and natural experiments. Objective The objective of this review is to answer the following research questions: 1. To what extent do interventions affect technology adoption in firms? 2. To what extent does technology adoption affect profits, employment, productivity, and yields? 3. Are these effects heterogeneous across sectors, firm size, countries, workers' skill level, or workers' gender? Selection Criteria To be included, papers had to meet the inclusion criteria described in detail in Section¬†3.1 which is grouped into four categories: (1) Participants, (2) Interventions, (3) Methodology, and (4) Outcomes. Regarding participants, our focus was on firms, and we omitted studies at the country or region level. In terms of interventions, we included studies that analyzed a source of exogenous variation in incentives for firms to adopt new technologies and estimated their effects. Thus, we left out studies that only looked at correlates of technology adoption, without a credible strategy to establish causality, and only included studies that used experimental or quasi-experimental methods. Regarding outcomes, papers were included only if they estimated effects of interventions (broadly defined) on technology adoption, although we also considered other firm outcomes as secondary outcomes in studies that reported them. Search Methods The first step in selecting the studies to be included in the systematic review was to identify a set of candidate papers. This set included both published and unpublished studies. To look for candidate papers, we implemented an electronic search and, in a subsequent step, a manual search. The electronic search involved running a keyword search on the most commonly used databases for published and unpublished academic studies in the broad topic area. The words and their Boolean combinations were carefully chosen (more details in Section¬†3.2). The selected papers were initially screened on title and abstract. If papers passed this screen, they were screened on full text. Those studies that met the stated criteria were then selected for analysis. The manual search component involved asking for references from experts and searching references cited by papers selected through the electronic search. These additional papers were screened based on title and abstract and the remaining were screened on full text. If they met the criteria they were added to the list of selected studies. Data Collection and Analysis For the selected studies, the relevant estimates of effects and their associated standard errors (SEs) were entered into an Excel spreadsheet along with other related information such as sample size, variable type, and duration for flow variables. Other information such as authors, year of publication, and country and/or region where the study was implemented was also included in the spreadsheet. Once the data were entered for each of the selected studies, the information on sample size, effect size and SE of the effect size was used to compute the standardized effect size for each study to make the results comparable across studies. For those studies for which relevant data were not reported, we contacted the authors by email and incorporated the information they provided. Forest plots were then generated and within-study pooled average treatment effects were computed by outcome variable. In addition, an assessment of reporting on potential biases was conducted including (1) reporting on key aspects of selection bias and confounding, (2) reporting on spillovers of interventions to comparison groups, (3) reporting of SEs, and (4) reporting on Hawthorne effects and the collection of retrospective data. Results The electronic and manual searches resulted in 42,462 candidate papers. Of these, 80 studies were ultimately selected for the review after screenings to apply the selection criteria. Relevant data were extracted for analysis from these 80 studies. Overall, 1108 regression coefficients across various interventions and outcomes were included in the analysis, representing a total of 4,762,755 firms. Even though the search methods included both high-income and developing countries, only 1 of the 80 studies included in the analysis was in a high-income country, while the remaining 79 were in developing countries. We discuss the results in two parts, looking at firms in manufacturing and services separately from firms (i.e., farms) in agriculture. In each case, we consider both technology adoption and other firm outcomes. Authors' Conclusions Overall, our results suggest that some interventions led to positive impacts on technology adoption among firms across manufacturing, services, and agriculture sectors, but given the wide variation in the time periods, contexts, and study methodologies, the results are hard to generalize. The effects of these interventions on other firm performance measures such as farm yields, firm profits, productivity, and employment were mixed. Policy-makers must be careful in interpreting these results as a given intervention may not work equally well across contexts and may need to be adjusted to each specific regional context. There is great need for more research on the barriers to technology adoption by firms in developing countries and interventions that may help alleviate these obstacles. One major implication for researchers from our review is that there is a need to carefully measure technology adoption.

N2  - Abstract Background A steady increase in the international production and consumption of fish has positioned aquaculture as a development option. Previous literature has highlighted the potential of aquaculture to improve economic, nutritional and gender equality outcomes, however, the evidence on the effectiveness of these programmes remains unclear. Objectives The review assessed whether aquaculture interventions increase the productivity, income, nutrition, and women's empowerment of individuals. We additionally aimed to identify barriers and facilitators that could affect the effectiveness of these interventions, and the cost-effectiveness of such programmes. Methods We searched for experimental and quasi-experimental studies focused on low- and middle-income countries. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Campbell Collaboration for the data collection and analysis. Results We identified 21 impact evaluations assessing the effect of 13 aquaculture interventions in low- and lower-middle income countries. Twelve of these studies have a high risk of bias. Aquaculture interventions lead to a small increase in the production value, income, total expenditures and food consumption of participants. The limited availability of evidence prevented us from assessing other nutritional and women's empowerment outcomes. We identified barriers and facilitators affecting the programmes' set up, the participation of beneficiaries, and the level of productive activities. Insufficient cost data hindered full comparisons across programmes. Conclusions The review suggests a lack of rigorous evidence assessing the effectiveness of aquaculture programmes. Future research could focus on evaluating nutrition and women's empowerment impacts, promoting reporting standards, and the use of cost data to continue building quality evidence around aquaculture interventions.

N2  - Abstract Background Two of the most central questions in radicalization research are, (1) why do some individuals radicalize when most of those from the same groups or exposed to similar conditions do not? and (2) why do radicalized individuals turn to radical violence while the majority remain inert? It has been suggested that the answer to both questions lie in the cumulative and interactive effects of a range of risk factors. While risk assessment and counter-radicalization take a risk-protective factor approach, there is widespread debate as to what these factors are and which are most important. Objectives This review has two primary objectives. 1) To identify what the putative risk and protective factors for different radicalization outcomes are, without any predeterminations. 2) To synthesize the evidence and identify the relative magnitude of the effects of different factors. The review's secondary objectives are to: 1) Identify consistencies in the estimates of factors across different radicalization outcomes. 2) Identify whether any significant heterogeneity exists within factors between (a) geographic regions, and (b) strains of radicalizing ideologies. Search Methods Over 20 databases were searched for both published and gray literature. In order to provide a more comprehensive review, supplementary searches were conducted in two German and one Dutch database. Reference harvesting was conducted from previous reviews and contact was made with leading researchers to identify and acquire missing or unpublished studies. Selection Criteria The review included observational studies assessing the outcomes of radical attitudes, intentions, and/or radical behaviors in OECD countries and which provided sufficient data to calculate effect sizes for individual-level risk and protective factors. Data Collection and Analysis One-hundred and twenty-seven studies, containing 206 samples met the inclusion criteria and provided 1302 effect sizes pertaining to over 100 different factors. Random effects meta-analyses were carried out for each factor, and meta-regression and moderator analysis were used to explore differences across studies. Results Studies were primarily cross-sectional, with samples representing 20 countries OECD countries. Most studies examined no specific radicalizing ideology, while others focussed on specific ideologies (e.g., Islamist, right-wing, and left-wing ideologies). The studies generally demonstrated low risk of bias and utilized validated or widely acceptable measures for both indicators and outcomes. With some exceptions, sociodemographic factors tend to have the smallest estimates, with larger estimates for experiential and attitudinal factors, followed by traditional criminogenic and psychological factors. Authors' Conclusions While sociodemographic factors are the most commonly examined factors (selective availability), they also tend to have the smallest estimates. So too, attitudinal and even experiential factors, do not have effect sizes of the magnitude that could lead to significant reductions in risk through targeting by interventions. Conversely, traditional criminogenic factors, as well as psychological factors tend to display the largest estimates. These findings suggest the need to broaden the scope of factors considered in both risk assessment and intervention, and this review provides much needed evidence for guiding the selection of factors.

N2  - Abstract Background Almost two billion people who are deficient in vitamins and minerals are women and children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). These deficiencies are worsened during pregnancy due to increased energy and nutritional demands, causing adverse outcomes in mother and child. To reduce micronutrient deficiencies, several strategies have been implemented, including diet diversification, large-scale and targeted fortification, staple crop bio-fortification and micronutrient supplementation. Objectives To evaluate and summarize the available evidence on the effects of micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy in LMIC on maternal, fetal, child health and child development outcomes. This review will assess the impact of single micronutrient supplementation (calcium, vitamin A, iron, vitamin D, iodine, zinc, vitamin B12), iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation, multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation, and lipid-based nutrient supplementation (LNS) during pregnancy. Search Methods We searched papers published from 1995 to 31 October 2019 (related programmes and good quality studies pre-1995 were limited) in CAB Abstracts, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, International Initiative for Impact Evaluations, LILACS, Medline, POPLINE, Web of Science, WHOLIS, ProQuest Dissertations  women were not excluded on this basis. Data Collection and Analysis Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and risk of bias, and conducted data extraction. Data were matched to check for accuracy. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main Results A total of 314 papers across 72 studies (451,723 women) were eligible for inclusion, of which 64 studies (439,649 women) contributed to meta-analyses. Seven studies assessed iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation versus folic acid; 34 studies assessed MMN vs. IFA; 4 studies assessed LNS vs. MMN; 13 evaluated iron; 13 assessed zinc; 9 evaluated vitamin A; 11 assessed vitamin D; and 6 assessed calcium. Several studies were eligible for inclusion in multiple types of supplementation. IFA compared to folic acid showed a large and significant (48%) reduction in the risk of maternal anaemia (average risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.66; studies = 5; participants = 15,540; moderate-quality evidence). As well, IFA supplementation demonstrated a smaller but significant, 12% reduction in risk of low birthweight (LBW) babies (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; studies = 4; participants = 17,257; high-quality evidence). MMN supplementation was defined as any supplement that contained at least 3 micronutrients. Post-hoc analyses were conducted, where possible, comparing the differences in effect of MMN with 4+ components and MMN with 3 or 4 components. When compared to iron with or without FA, MMN supplementation reduced the risk of LBW by 15% (average RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.93; studies = 28; participants = 79,972); this effect was greater in MMN with >4 micronutrients (average RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88; studies = 19; participants = 68,138 versus average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; studies = 9; participants = 11,834). There was a small and significant reduction in the risk of stillbirths (average RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.98; studies = 22; participants = 96,772) and a small and significant effect on the risk of small-for-gestational age (SGA) (average RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.98; studies = 19; participants = 52,965). For stillbirths and SGA, the effects were greater among those provided MMN with 4+ micronutrients. Children whose mothers had been supplemented with MMN, compared to IFA, demonstrated a 16% reduced risk of diarrhea (average RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92; studies = 4; participants = 3,142). LNS supplementation, compared to MMN, made no difference to any outcome; however, the evidence is limited. Iron supplementation, when compared to no iron or placebo, showed a large and significant effect on maternal anaemia, a reduction of 47% (average RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.65; studies = 6; participants = 15,737; moderate-quality evidence) and a small and significant effect on LBW (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; studies = 4; participants = 17,257; high-quality evidence). Zinc and vitamin A supplementation, each both compared to placebo, had no impact on any outcome examined with the exception of potentially improving serum/plasma zinc (mean difference (MD) 0.43 umol/L; 95% CI ?0.04 to 0.89; studies = 5; participants = 1,202) and serum/plasma retinol (MD 0.13 umol/L; 95% CI ?0.03 to 0.30; studies = 6; participants = 1,654), respectively. When compared to placebo, vitamin D supplementation may have reduced the risk of preterm births (average RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.04; studies = 7; participants = 1,262), though the upper CI just crosses the line of no effect. Similarly, calcium supplementation versus placebo may have improved rates of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (average RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.06; studies = 4; participants = 9,616), though the upper CI just crosses 1. Authors' Conclusions The findings suggest that MMN and vitamin supplementation improve maternal and child health outcomes, including maternal anaemia, LBW, preterm birth, SGA, stillbirths, micronutrient deficiencies, and morbidities, including pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and diarrhea among children. MMN supplementation demonstrated a beneficial impact on the most number of outcomes. In addition, MMN with >4 micronutrients appeared to be more impactful than MMN with only 3 or 4 micronutrients included in the tablet. Very few studies conducted longitudinal analysis on longer-term health outcomes for the child, such as anthropometric measures and developmental outcomes; this may be an important area for future research. This review may provide some basis to guide continual discourse around replacing IFA supplementation with MMN along with the use of single micronutrient supplementation programs for specific outcomes.

N2  - Abstract Background Homelessness has emerged as a public health priority, with growing numbers of vulnerable populations despite advances in social welfare. In February 2020, the United Nations passed a historic resolution, identifying the need to adopt social-protection systems and ensure access to safe and affordable housing for all. The establishment of housing stability is a critical outcome that intersects with other social inequities. Prior research has shown that in comparison to the general population, people experiencing homelessness have higher rates of infectious diseases, chronic illnesses, and mental-health disorders, along with disproportionately poorer outcomes. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify effective interventions to improve the lives of people living with homelessness. Objectives The objective of this systematic review is to identify, appraise, and synthesise the best available evidence on the benefits and cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve the health and social outcomes of people experiencing homelessness. Search Methods In consultation with an information scientist, we searched nine bibliographic databases, including Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL, from database inception to February 10, 2020 using keywords and MeSH terms. We conducted a focused grey literature search and consulted experts for additional studies. Selection Criteria Teams of two reviewers independently screened studies against our inclusion criteria. We included randomised control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies conducted among populations experiencing homelessness in high-income countries. Eligible interventions included permanent supportive housing (PSH), income assistance, standard case management (SCM), peer support, mental health interventions such as assertive community treatment (ACT), intensive case management (ICM), critical time intervention (CTI) and injectable antipsychotics, and substance-use interventions, including supervised consumption facilities (SCFs), managed alcohol programmes and opioid agonist therapy. Outcomes of interest were housing stability, mental health, quality of life, substance use, hospitalisations, employment and income. Data Collection and Analysis Teams of two reviewers extracted data in duplicate and independently. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We performed our statistical analyses using RevMan 5.3. For dichotomous data, we used odds ratios and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous data, we used the mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI if the outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We used the standardised mean difference with a 95% CI to combine trials that measured the same outcome but used different methods of measurement. Whenever possible, we pooled effect estimates using a random-effects model. Main Results The search resulted in 15,889 citations. We included 86 studies (128 citations) that examined the effectiveness and/or cost-effectiveness of interventions for people with lived experience of homelessness. Studies were conducted in the United States (73), Canada (8), United Kingdom (2), the Netherlands (2) and Australia (1). The studies were of low to moderate certainty, with several concerns regarding the risk of bias. PSH was found to have significant benefits on housing stability as compared to usual care. These benefits impacted both high- and moderate-needs populations with significant cimorbid mental illness and substance-use disorders. PSH may also reduce emergency department visits and days spent hospitalised. Most studies found no significant benefit of PSH on mental-health or substance-use outcomes. The effect on quality of life was also mixed and unclear. In one study, PSH resulted in lower odds of obtaining employment. The effect on income showed no significant differences. Income assistance appeared to have some benefits in improving housing stability, particularly in the form of rental subsidies. Although short-term improvement in depression and perceived stress levels were reported, no evidence of the long-term effect on mental health measures was found. No consistent impact on the outcomes of quality of life, substance use, hospitalisations, employment status, or earned income could be detected when compared with usual services. SCM interventions may have a small beneficial effect on housing stability, though results were mixed. Results for peer support interventions were also mixed, though no benefit was noted in housing stability specifically. Mental health interventions (ICM, ACT, CTI) appeared to reduce the number of days homeless and had varied effects on psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and substance use over time. Cost analyses of PSH interventions reported mixed results. Seven studies showed that PSH interventions were associated with increased cost to payers and that the cost of the interventions were only partially offset by savings in medical- and social-services costs. Six studies revealed that PSH interventions saved the payers money. Two studies focused on the cost-effectiveness of income-assistance interventions. For each additional day housed, clients who received income assistance incurred additional costs of US$45 (95% CI, ?$19, ?$108) from the societal perspective. In addition, the benefits gained from temporary financial assistance were found to outweigh the costs, with a net savings of US$20,548. The economic implications of case management interventions (SCM, ICM, ACT, CTI) was highly uncertain. SCM clients were found to incur higher costs than those receiving the usual care. For ICM, all included studies suggested that the intervention may be cost-offset or cost-effective. Regarding ACT, included studies consistently revealed that ACT saved payers money and improved health outcomes than usual care. Despite having comparable costs (US$52,574 vs. US$51,749), CTI led to greater nonhomeless nights (508 vs. 450 nights) compared to usual services. Authors' Conclusions PSH interventions improved housing stability for people living with homelessness. High-intensity case management and income-assistance interventions may also benefit housing stability. The majority of included interventions inconsistently detected benefits for mental health, quality of life, substance use, employment and income. These results have important implications for public health, social policy, and community programme implementation. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to tackle systemic inequality and address social determinants of health. Our review provides timely evidence on PSH, income assistance, and mental health interventions as a means of improving housing stability. PSH has major cost and policy implications and this approach could play a key role in ending homelessness. Evidence-based reviews like this one can guide practice and outcome research and contribute to advancing international networks committed to solving homelessness.

N2  - Abstract Background Optimal nutrition plays a crucial role in pregnancy. Poor maternal nutrition and maternal obesity has risk factors for serious fetal complications and neonatal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, congenital abnormalities, stillbirth, low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth, fetal macrosomia, increased risk of neonatal infections, neonatal hypothermia, and neonatal death. The prevalence of maternal malnutrition is higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (10?19%) when compared with high-income countries, with variation by region and by country. Several behavioral interventions, including dietary control and exercise, have been found to reduce the risk of these adverse outcomes. However, none has reviewed dietary interventions to prevent maternal obesity in pregnant women. Objectives The review aims to assess the effectiveness of balanced energy protein (BEP) supplementation, food distribution programs (FDPs), and dietary interventions to prevent maternal obesity during pregnancy on birth, child health, and developmental outcomes. Search Methods We searched Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and 12 other databases, and trials registers for ongoing studies up until April 2019. We also searched for gray literature from different sources and for citations on Google Scholar and Web of Sciences. We also checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews and contacted the authors of studies for any ongoing and unpublished studies. The search was followed by title/abstract screening, full-text screening and data extraction. Selection Criteria We included randomized control trials, and quasi experimental trials to evaluate the impact of nutritional interventions (BEP, FDP, and dietary interventions to prevent maternal obesity) compared to control or standard of care, among healthy pregnant women of any age living in LMICs. Data Collection and Analysis Two review authors independently assessed and screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed quality of the studies included in the review. We conducted a meta-analysis of all reported primary and secondary outcomes. Subgroup analysis and GRADE assessment was performed for all reported primary outcomes. Main Results The review included 15 studies, of these, eight were on BEP supplementation, five on FDP, and two on interventions for obesity prevention. BEP supplementation may show a reduction in the rate of stillbirths by 61% (risk ratio [RR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19?0.80; three studies, n?=?1913; low quality on GRADE), perinatal mortality by 50% (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30?0.84; one study, n?=?1446; low quality on GRADE), LBW infants by 40% (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41?0.86; three studies, n?=?1830; low quality of evidence on GRADE); small for gestational age (SGA) by 29% (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54?0.94; five studies, n?=?1844) and increased birth weight by 107.28?g (mean difference [MD], 107.28?g; 95% CI, 68.51?146.04, eight studies, n?=?2190). An increase of 107.28?g of birthweight is clinically significant in the countries where the intervention was provided. BEP supplementation had no effect on miscarriage, neonatal mortality, infant mortality, preterm birth, birth length, and head circumference. FDP may show improvement in mean birth weight by 46?g (MD, 46.00?g; 95% CI, 45.10?46.90, three studies, n?=?5272), in birth length by 0.20?cm (MD, 0.20?cm; 95% CI, 0.20?0.20, three studies, n?=?5272), and reduction in stunting by 18% (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71?0.94; two studies; n?=?4166), and wasting by 13% (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78?0.97; two studies, n?=?3883). There was no effect of FDP on miscarriage, maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, infant mortality, preterm birth, LBW, SGA, head circumference, and underweight babies. Studies on interventions for obesity prevention among pregnant women failed to report on the primary outcomes. The studies showed a 195.57?g reduction in mean birth weight (MD, ?195.57?g, 95% CI, ?349.46 to ?41.68, two studies, n?=?180), and had no effect on birth length, and macrosomia. Authors' Conclusions Our review highlights improvement in maternal, birth, and child outcomes through BEP supplementation and FDP during pregnancy. But, due to the small number of included studies and low quality of evidence, we are uncertain of the effect of BEP supplementation, FDP and dietary interventions for prevention of obesity on maternal, and child outcomes. Thus, further good quality research is recommended to assess the effect of these interventions on maternal, child and developmental outcomes.

N2  - Abstract Background Agroforestry, the intentional integration of trees or other woody perennials with crops or livestock in production systems, is being widely promoted as a conservation and development tool to help meet the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Donors, governments, and nongovernmental organizations have invested significant time and resources into developing and promoting agroforestry policies and programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) worldwide. While a large body of literature on the impacts of agroforestry practices in LMICs is available, the social-ecological impacts of agroforestry interventions is less well-studied. This knowledge gap on the effectiveness of agroforestry interventions constrains possibilities for evidence-based policy and investment decisions to advance sustainable development objectives. Objectives The primary objective of this Campbell systematic review was to synthesize the available evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions in LMICs on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. The secondary objectives were to identify key pathways through which agroforestry interventions lead to various outcomes and how the interventions affect different sub-groups of the population. Search Methods This review is based on a previously created evidence and gap map (EGM) of studies evaluating the impacts of agroforestry practices and interventions on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. We included published and unpublished literature in the English language covering the period between 2000 and October 20, 2017. We searched six academic databases and 19 organization websites to identify potentially relevant studies. The search was conducted for our EGM in mid-2017, and we did not conduct an additional search for this systematic review. Selection Criteria We included randomized control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies assessing the effect of an agroforestry intervention on at least one outcome measure of agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, or human well-being for farmers and their farmland in LMICs. Agroforestry interventions include any program or policy designed to promote and support the adoption or maintenance of agroforestry practices, which include trees on farms, silvopasture, shade-grown crops, and homegardens with trees, among others. Moreover, the studies needed to include a nonagroforestry comparator, such as conventional agriculture or forestry systems or a before-after comparison. Data Collection and Analysis We used a standardized data extraction spreadsheet to extract details about each included study. We also used a standardized form to assess risk of bias for each of the included studies in this SR. Meta-analysis techniques were used to combine and synthesize effect size estimates for the outcomes measures that had sufficient data. We used a random effects models for the meta-analyses and use Hedge's g (difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation) to report effect size estimates. The outcomes without enough evidence for meta-analysis were discussed narratively. Main Results We identified 11 studies across nine countries, all of which used quasi-experimental methods. Overall, the quality of the evidence base was assessed as being low. Studies were rated as having high or critical risk of bias if they failed to convincingly address more than one of the main potential sources of bias, namely selection bias, group equivalence, and spillover effects. Given the low number of studies and the high risk of bias of the evidence base, the results of this SR are limited and should be considered a baseline for future work. The results of the meta-analysis for impacts on yields indicated that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a large, positive impact on yield (Hedge's g?=?1.16 [?0.35, 2.67] (p?=?.13)), though there was high heterogeneity in the results (I2?=?98.99%, œÑ 2?=?2.94, Q(df?=?4) ?=?370.7). There were positive yield impacts for soil fertility replenishment practices, including incorporating trees in agricultural fields and improved fallow practices in fields where there are severe soil fertility issues. In other cases, incorporating trees into the production system reduced productivity and took land out of production for conservation benefits. These systems generally used an incentive provision scheme to economically offset the reductions in yields. The result of the meta-analysis on income suggests that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a small, positive impact on income (Hedge's g?=?0.12 [?0.06, 0.30] (p?=?.20)), with moderately high heterogeneity in the results (I2?=?75.29%, œÑ 2?=?0.04, Q(df?=?6)?=?19.16). In cases where improvement yields were reported, there were generally attendant improvements in income. In the cases where payments were provided to offset the potential loss in yields, incomes also generally improved, though there were mixed results for the certification programs and the tenure security permitting scheme. One program, which study authors suggested may have been poorly targeted, had negative yield impacts. There was not enough comparable evidence to quantitatively synthesize the impacts of agroforestry interventions on nutrition and food security outcomes, though the results indicted positive or neutral impacts on dietary diversity and food intake were likely. Surprisingly, there was little evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions on environmental outcomes, and there was no consistency of environmental indicator variables used. However, what has been studied indicates that the environmental benefits are being achieved to at least some extent, consistent with the broader literature on agroforestry practices. The evidence base was insufficient to evaluate the interaction between environmental and social impacts. Several studies explicitly considered variable impacts across different population sub-groups, including differential impacts on small-holders versus large-holders, on woman-headed households versus male-headed households, and on richer groups versus poorer groups. Small-holder farmers typically experienced the most positive effect sizes due to the agroforestry interventions. Women and poorer groups had mixed outcomes relative to men and richer households, highlighting the importance of considering these groups in intervention design. Authors' Conclusions There is limited evidence of the impacts of agroforestry interventions, restricting our ability to draw conclusions on the effect sizes of different intervention types. The existing evidence forms a baseline for future research and highlights the importance of considering equity and socio-economic factors in determining suitable intervention design. Some key implications for practice and policy include investing in programs that include pilot programs, funding for project evaluation, and that address key equity issues, such as targeting to smallholders, women, poor, and marginalized groups. Funding should also be given to implementing RCTs and more rigorous quasi-experimental impact evaluations of agroforestry interventions over longer time-periods to collect robust evidence of the effectiveness of various schemes promoting agroforestry practices.

N2  - Executive summary/Abstract Background In spite of the large number of anti-corruption reforms implemented in different countries, there has been little research that empirically and systematically assesses the impact of these efforts. Objectives The main objective of this review is to identify what works in curbing corruption in the public sector, by meta-analyzing the findings of published and unpublished evaluations of different types of anti-corruption interventions in different countries. The focus of this review is administrative corruption, namely corrupt acts involving civil servants in their dealings with their superiors, during the implementation of public policies, or while interacting with the public for service delivery. Political corruption (in the adoption of laws, regulations, and policies), and private-to-private corruption (involving only private actors) are excluded from this review. Search methods The literature search was conducted by querying three widely recognized electronic databases: RePEc, SSRN, and Web of Science. These databases are considered the most comprehensive in the socio-economic field of research. The main grey literature repositories were also queried. Both published and unpublished studies were searched on the basis of specific combinations of keywords. The terms used to define queries were based on the ?types of corruption?, ?types of interventions/policies/reforms? and ?study design? search strings. Specific conventions were used to ?explode? or ?truncate? keywords as appropriate. Screening of the references (i.e., snowballing) of the identified studies was also performed, and a reverse snowballing approach on Google Scholar was used. In order to ensure replicability, all searches were stored into Covidence, an online software developed by the Cochrane community for screening studies and extracting data for systematic reviews. Selection criteria Any study that included experimental evaluations (randomized controlled trials) of interventions developed for use in the public sector (e.g., public administration, education, health, etc.) to curb administrative corruption has been included in this review without any geographical or temporal limitations. Only studies written in or translated into English have been considered. Data collection and analysis Two review authors read the titles and abstracts of identified studies in order to determine their eligibility against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. When a title or abstract could not be included or rejected with certainty, the full text of the article was reviewed. In case of disagreement about whether or not a study should be included, the lead author (Giulia Mugellini), together with Martin Killias acted as arbitrator. The relevant information from identified studies was extracted independently by two review authors, following the guidelines of the Campbell Collaboration. The studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias checklist as a basis. The effect size selected for the analysis was the Fisher's z-score transformation of the partial correlation coefficient. For the meta-analysis, random effect(s) models were estimated. Meta-regression analysis models were then used to investigate the determinants behind the observed between- and within-study heterogeneity. Ten different covariates were included in the meta-regression models in order to control for the type of intervention, the type of corruption, the level of national income, the quality of the study and the type of participants involved in laboratory experiments. Results The initial literature search led to the identification of 70 studies. Approximately one-third of the studies were excluded at the title/abstract stage because they either did not evaluate any anti-corruption intervention but simply assessed the relationship between corruption and other phenomena, or because the study design was not based on randomized controlled trials. Another 14 studies were excluded only after a full-text assessment. At this stage, the main reasons for exclusion were related to an unsuitable type of corruption (e.g., when the focus of the paper was political corruption, or private-to-private corruption instead of administrative corruption), the lack of regression output, or an unsuitable study design. At the end of the selection process, 29 studies resulted as eligible for inclusion. All the selected studies were written in English. The publication years ranged from 2007 to 2018. The majority of the selected studies (20) investigates the effect of anti-corruption interventions in high- and upper-middle income countries (Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Nine studies focused on low- and low-middle income countries (Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda). All of them were randomized experiments. Twenty-five of these experiments were conducted in a laboratory, while four of them were field experiments. As to the type of outcome, the majority (18) of the selected studies addressed bribery (either active or passive), while 11 studies considered misappropriation of public resources (embezzlement). In terms of anti-corruption interventions, 19 studies tested the effect of deterrence interventions, while 10 studies focused on policies based on organizational and cultural change. Overall, the meta-analysis? findings indicate that the identified interventions decrease the level of corruption. Results are statistically significant (p?<?0.01) and robust to different heterogeneity estimators?that is, (restricted) maximum likelihood and method of moment estimators. The observed high level of heterogeneity? I 2 is equal to 92.36%, of which 43.78% is due to between-study heterogeneity and 48.57% to within-study heterogeneity?albeit in line with other meta-analyses in economics, suggests the need for meta-regression analyses. To investigate the determinants behind the between- and within-study heterogeneity of the observed effect, both a random effect model and a multilevel model were adopted. The results of the multilevel model show that: 1) Control and deterrence interventions are more effective than organizational and cultural reforms in reducing corruption in the public sector. 2) Combining different interventions reduces corruption more than single interventions. 3) Interventions are more effective in preventing misappropriation of public resources (embezzlement) than passive or active bribery. Finally, the Funnel Asymmetry Test (FAT), conducted with both additive and multiplicative dispersion terms, shows no evidence of a strong publication bias in the literature. Authors? conclusions The results of this systematic review, based on a combination of laboratory and field experiments, demonstrate that increasing the expected monetary costs (e.g., sanctions) of corruption or the probability of detection (e.g., audit risk) is more effective than organizational, cultural and educational interventions in curbing administrative corruption, at least in the short term. However, this result might be due to the fact that the majority of selected studies are based on lab-experiments, where the assessment of the intervention is almost concurrent to its development. Short-term evaluations might fail to identify the effect of organizational and cultural interventions. Indeed, these interventions are based on structural changes in the organization of the system and the ethical and cultural education of public officials and might, thus, entail long periods to display their results on the level of corruption. Nevertheless, a combination of different interventions proves to be more effective than single interventions. For example, policies guaranteeing impunity to officials or citizens who report corrupt practices (principal witness/leniency treatment) are more effective if associated with a high probability of audit than leniency alone. A low probability of detection can be compensated by the threat of high fines in reducing both the amount and the likelihood of bribe demands. To the contrary, a high probability of detection had no effect in the absence of severe sanction threats. The importance of the organizational and cultural environment in which the intervention is implemented clearly emerged in the literature. When possible, the characteristics of the settings where the interventions were developed were included in the meta-regression analysis (such as the level of income of the countries). When it was not possible to measure contextual factors and their interaction with the main intervention, a qualitative analysis was performed to reveal the complexities of these interactions. This additional analysis shows that the impact of the interventions was found to be affected by the likelihood of the continued interactions between bribe takers and givers, the amount and probability of fines, and the size of the bribe, among others. For example, reporting mechanisms and leniency policies increase their potential in combination with interventions that limit agent's exposure to one another ? such as staff rotation. The success of audit risk on corruption is strongly dependent on the seriousness of the potential sanction and the probability that a sanction is applied. Some differences also emerge between high- and low-corruption countries regarding the effectiveness of anti-corruption interventions. For example, measures tending to increase social blame of corrupt practices work in low-corruption countries. Adding punishments in environments where actors? behavior is tightly monitored increases compliance, but more so in environments where corruption is the exception rather than the rule. In terms of implications for research, the fact that control and deterrence turns out to be more effective than organizational and cultural interventions in curbing administrative corruption confirms the importance of economic theories (and cost-benefit analysis). However, the meta-analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of combining different types of interventions. This is true not only when combining policies reinforcing control and deterrence (monitoring frequency, detection probability and amount of fines), but also when policies based on organizational and cultural change are added (e.g., staff rotation and leniency). In particular, the role of moral levers in preventing corruption emerges, and especially the importance of strengthening professional identity and values in order to avoid conflicts between an individual's private interests and his/her public role. These results highlight the importance of going beyond economic models for explaining corruption, and considering the moral and cultural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. It also emerges the need to understand how different forms of corruption operate in practice at macro- (cross-country), meso- (country/nation-state) and micro- (individual) level. In particular, individual-level factors, such as the strive for power, low self-control, loss aversion and risk acceptance would need to be addressed. It would be interesting to distinguish, when more experimental studies will be available, between top-down (from supervisors to officials) and bottom-up (from citizens to officials) interventions. From a methodological point of view, it could be tested whether the results change according to the types of games used as a basis for the corruption experiments (e.g., behavioral game theory, trust game, etc.) and according to the setting in which the experiment was conducted (e.g., context-free versus in-context presentation of experimental tasks). Considering the effect of sensitization messages in reducing bribery demand, we would encourage researchers to develop other corruption experiments that explore the impact of interventions in fostering professional self-identity, as well as the impact of organizational family culture on corruption. Furthermore, this review highlights the need for a comprehensive classification of anti-corruption policies that distinguishes interventions by type of corruption, risk factors, type of policy tool and administrative sector.

N2  - Abstract Background Globally, almost 1.6 billion individuals lack adequate housing. Many accommodation-based approaches have evolved across the globe to incorporate additional support and services beyond delivery of housing. Objectives This review examines the effectiveness of accommodation-based approaches on outcomes including housing stability, health, employment, crime, wellbeing, and cost for individuals experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. Search Methods The systematic review is based on evidence already identified in two existing EGMs commissioned by the Centre for Homelessness Impact (CHI) and built by White et al. The maps were constructed using a comprehensive three stage search and mapping process. Stage one mapped included studies in an existing systematic review on homelessness, stage two was an extensive search of 17 academic databases, three EGM databases, and eight systematic review databases. Finally stage three included web searches for grey literature, scanning reference lists of included studies and consultation with experts to identify additional literature. We identified 223 unique studies across 551 articles from the effectiveness map on 12th April 2019. Selection Criteria We include research on all individuals currently experiencing, or at risk of experiencing homelessness irrespective of age or gender, in high-income countries. The Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) contains all study designs where a comparison group was used. This includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental designs, matched comparisons and other study designs that attempt to isolate the impact of the intervention on homelessness. The NMA primarily addresses how interventions can reduce homelessness and increase housing stability for those individuals experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, homelessness. Additional outcomes are examined and narratively described. These include: access to mainstream healthcare; crime and justice; employment and income; capabilities and wellbeing; and cost of intervention. These outcomes reflect the domains used in the EGM, with the addition of cost. Data Collection and Analysis Due to the diverse nature of the literature on accommodation-based approaches, the way in which the approaches are implemented in practice, and the disordered descriptions of the categories, the review team created a novel typology to allow meaningful categorisations for functional and useful comparison between the various intervention types. Once these eligible categories were identified, we undertook dual data extraction, where two authors completed data extraction and risk of bias (ROB) assessments independently for each study. NMA was conducted across outcomes related to housing stability and health.Qualitative data from process evaluations is included using a ?Best Fit? Framework synthesis. The purpose of this synthesis is to complement the quantitative evidence and provide a better understanding of what factors influenced programme effectiveness. All included Qualitative data followed the initial framework provided by the five main analytical categories of factors of influence (reflected in the EGM), namely: contextual factors, policy makers/funders, programme administrators/managers/implementing agencies, staff/case workers and recipients of the programme. Main Results There was a total of 13,128 people included in the review, across 51 reports of 28 studies. Most of the included studies were carried out in the United States of America (25/28), with other locations including Canada and the UK. Sixteen studies were RCTs (57%) and 12 were nonrandomised (quasi-experimental) designs (43%). Assessment of methodological quality and potential for bias was conducted using the second version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for Randomised controlled trials. Nonrandomised studies were coded using the ROBINS- I tool. Out of the 28 studies, three had sufficiently low ROB (11%), 11 (39%) had moderate ROB, and five (18%) presented serious problems with ROB, and nine (32%) demonstrated high, critical problems with their methodology. A NMA on housing stability outcomes demonstrates that interventions offering the highest levels of support alongside unconditional accommodation (High/Unconditional) were more effective in improving housing stability compared to basic support alongside unconditional housing (Basic/Unconditional) (ES=1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.39, 1.82]), and in comparison to a no-intervention control group (ES=0.62, 95% CI [0.19, 1.06]). A second NMA on health outcomes demonstrates that interventions categorised as offering Moderate/Conditional (ES=?0.36, 95% CI [0.03, 0.69]) and High/Unconditional (ES?=?0.22, 95% CI [0.01, 0.43]) support were effective in improving health outcomes compared to no intervention. These effects were smaller than those observed for housing stability. The quality of the evidence was relatively low but varied across the 28 included studies. Depending on the context, finding accommodation for those who need it can be hindered by supply and affordability in the market. The social welfare approach in each jurisdiction can impact heavily on support available and can influence some of the prejudice and stigma surrounding homelessness. The evaluations emphasised the need for collaboration and a shared commitment between policymakers, funders and practitioners which creates community and buy in across sectors and agencies. However, co-ordinating this is difficult and requires sustainability to work. For those implementing programmes, it was important to invest time in developing a culture together to build trust and solid relationships. Additionally, identifying sufficient resources and appropriate referral routes allows for better implementation planning. Involving staff and case workers in creating processes helps drive enthusiasm and energy for the service. Time should be allocated for staff to develop key skills and communicate engage effectively with service users. Finally, staff need time to develop trust and relationships with service users; this goes hand in hand with providing information that is up to date and useful as well making themselves accessible in terms of location and time. Authors' Conclusions The network meta-analysis suggests that all types of accommodation which provided support are more effective than no intervention or Basic/Unconditional accommodation in terms of housing stability and health. The qualitative evidence synthesis raised a primary issue in relation to context: which was the lack of stable, affordable accommodation and the variability in the rental market, such that actually sourcing accommodation to provide for individuals who are homeless is extremely challenging. Collaboration between stakeholders and practitioners can be fruitful but difficult to coordinate across different agencies and organisations.

N2  - Abstract Background The preconception period is an ideal time to introduce interventions relating to nutrition and other lifestyle factors to ensure good pregnancy preparedness, and to promote health of mothers and babies. In adolescents, malnutrition and early pregnancy are the common challenges, particularly among those who live in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where 99% of all maternal and newborn deaths occur. These girls receive little or no attention until their first pregnancy and often the interventions after pregnancy are too late to revert any detrimental health risks that may have occurred due to malnutrition and early pregnancy. Objectives To synthesise the evidence of the effectiveness of preconception care interventions relating to delayed age at first pregnancy, optimising inter-pregnancy intervals, periconception folic acid, and periconception iron-folic acid supplementation on maternal, pregnancy, birth and child outcomes. Search Methods Numerous electronic databases (e.g., CINAHL, ERIC) and databases of selected development agencies or research firms were systematically searched for all available years up to July 2019. In addition, we searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, and asked experts in the area about ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection Criteria Primary studies, including large-scale programme evaluations that assessed the effectiveness of interventions using randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental designs (natural experiments, controlled before-after studies, regression discontinuity designs, interrupted time series [ITS]), that targeted women of reproductive age (i.e., 10?49?years) during the pre- and periconceptional period in LMICs were included. Interventions were compared against no intervention, standard of care or placebo. Data Collection and Analysis Two or more review authors independently reviewed searches, selected studies for inclusion or exclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used random-effects model to conduct meta-analyses, given the diverse contexts, participants, and interventions, and separate meta-analyses for the same outcome was performed with different study designs (ITS, RCTs and controlled before after studies). For each comparison, the findings were descriptively summarised in text which included detailing the contextual factors (e.g., setting) to assess their impact on the implementation and effectiveness of each intervention. Main Results We included a total of 43 studies; two of these were included in both delaying pregnancy and optimising interpregnancy intervals resulting in 26 studies for delaying the age at first pregnancy (14 RCTs, 12 quasi-experimental), four for optimising interpregnancy intervals (one RCT, three quasi-experimental), five on periconceptional folic acid supplementation (two RCTs, three quasi-experimental), and 10 on periconceptional iron-folic acid supplementation (nine RCTs, one quasi-experimental). Geographically, studies were predominantly conducted across Africa and Asia, with few studies from North and Central America and took place in a combination of settings including community, schools and clinical. The education on sexual health and contraception interventions to delay the age at first pregnancy may make little or no difference on risk of unintended pregnancy (risk ratio [RR], 0.42; 95% confidence internal [CI], 0.07?3.26; two studies, =490; random-effect; ? 2 p?.009; I 2?=?85%; low certainty of evidence using GRADE assessment), however, it significantly improved the use of condom (ever) (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.08?2.20; six studies, n?=?1604; random-effect, heterogeneity: ? 2 p?.004; I 2?=?71%). Education on sexual health and and provision of contraceptive along with involvement of male partneron optimising interpregnancy intervals probably makes little or no difference on the risk of unintended pregnancies when compared to education on sexual health only (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.01?7.45; one study, n?=?45; moderate certainty of evidence using GRADE assessments). However, education on sexual health and contraception intervention alone or with provision of contraceptive showed a significant improvement in the uptake of contraceptive method. We are uncertain whether periconceptional folic acid supplementation reduces the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41?0.77; two studies, n?=?248,056; random-effect; heterogeneity: ? 2 p?.36; I 2?=?0%; very low certainty of evidence using GRADE assessment). We are uncertain whether preconception iron-folic acid supplementation reduces anaemia (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53?0.81; six studies; n?=?3430, random-effect; heterogeneity: ? 2 p?<?.001; I 2?=?88%; very low certainty of evidence using GRADE assessment) even when supplemented weekly (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55?0.88; six studies; n?=?2661; random-effect; heterogeneity: ? 2 p?<?.001; I 2?=?88%; very low certainty of evidence using GRADE assessments),and in school set-ups (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51?0.86; four studies; n?=?3005; random-effect; heterogeneity: ? 2 p?<?.0001; I 2?=?87%; very low certainty of evidence using GRADE assessment). Data on adverse effects were reported on in five studies for iron-folic acid, with the main complaint relating to gastrointestinal side effects. The quality of evidence across the interventions of interest was variable (ranging from very low to moderate) which may be attributed to the different study designs included in this review. Concerning risk of bias, the most common concerns were related to blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) and whether there were similar baseline characteristic across intervention and comparison groups. Authors' Conclusions There is evidence that education on sexual health and contraception interventions can improve contraceptive use and knowledge related to sexual health, this review also provides further support for the use of folic acid in pregnancy to reduce NTDs, and notes that weekly regimes of IFA are most effective in reducing anaemia. However the certainty of the evidence was very low and therefore more robust trials and research is required, including ensuring consistency for reporting unplanned pregnancies, and further studies to determine which intervention settings (school, community, clinic) are most effective. Although this review demonstrates promising findings, more robust evidence from RCTs are required from LMICs to further support the evidence.

N2  - Abstract Background Multiagency responses to reduce radicalisation often involve collaborations between police, government, nongovernment, business and/or community organisations. The complexities of radicalisation suggest it is impossible for any single agency to address the problem alone. Police-involved multiagency partnerships may disrupt pathways from radicalisation to violence by addressing multiple risk factors in a coordinated manner. Objectives 1. Synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of police-involved multiagency interventions on radicalisation or multiagency collaboration 2. Qualitatively synthesise information about how the intervention works (mechanisms), intervention context (moderators), implementation factors and economic considerations. Search Methods Terrorism-related terms were used to search the Global Policing Database, terrorism/counterterrorism websites and repositories, and relevant journals for published and unpublished evaluations conducted 2002?2018. The search was conducted November 2019. Expert consultation, reference harvesting and forward citation searching was conducted November 2020. Selection Criteria Eligible studies needed to report an intervention where police partnered with at least one other agency and explicitly aimed to address terrorism, violent extremism or radicalisation. Objective 1 eligible outcomes included violent extremism, radicalisation and/or terrorism, and multiagency collaboration. Only impact evaluations using experimental or robust quasi-experimental designs were eligible. Objective 2 placed no limits on outcomes. Studies needed to report an empirical assessment of an eligible intervention and provide data on mechanisms, moderators, implementation or economic considerations. Data Collection and Analysis The search identified 7384 records. Systematic screening identified 181 studies, of which five were eligible for Objective 1 and 26 for Objective 2. Effectiveness studies could not be meta-analysed, so were summarised and effect size data reported. Studies for Objective 2 were narratively synthesised by mechanisms, moderators, implementation, and economic considerations. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I, EPHPP, EMMIE and CASP checklists. Results One study examined the impact on vulnerability to radicalisation, using a quasi-experimental matched comparison group design and surveys of volunteers (n?=?191). Effects were small to medium and, aside from one item, favoured the intervention. Four studies examined the impact on the nature and quality of multiagency collaboration, using regression models and surveys of practitioners. Interventions included: alignment with national counterterrorism guidelines (n?=?272); number of counterterrorism partnerships (n?=?294); influence of, or receipt of, homeland security grants (n?=?350, n?=?208). Study findings were mixed. Of the 181 studies that examined mechanisms, moderators, implementation, and economic considerations, only 26 studies rigorously examined mechanisms (k?=?1), moderators (k?=?1), implementation factors (k?=?21) or economic factors (k?=?4). All included studies contained high risk of bias and/or methodological issues, substantially reducing confidence in the findings. Authors' Conclusions A limited number of effectiveness studies were identified, and none evaluated the impact on at-risk or radicalised individuals. More investment needs to be made in robust evaluation across a broader range of interventions. Qualitative synthesis suggests that collaboration may be enhanced when partners take time to build trust and shared goals, staff are not overburdened with administration, there are strong privacy provisions for intelligence sharing, and there is ongoing support and training.

N2  - Abstract Background Low levels of numeracy and literacy skills are associated with a range of negative outcomes later in life, such as reduced earnings and health. Obtaining information about effective interventions for children with or at risk of academic difficulties is therefore important. Objectives The main objective was to assess the effectiveness of interventions targeting students with or at risk of academic difficulties in kindergarten to Grade 6. Search Methods We searched electronic databases from 1980 to July 2018. We searched multiple international electronic databases (in total 15), seven national repositories, and performed a search of the grey literature using governmental sites, academic clearinghouses and repositories for reports and working papers, and trial registries (10 sources). We hand searched recent volumes of six journals and contacted international experts. Lastly, we used included studies and 23 previously published reviews for citation tracking. Selection Criteria Studies had to meet the following criteria to be included: Population: The population eligible for the review included students attending regular schools in kindergarten to Grade 6, who were having academic difficulties, or were at risk of such difficulties. Intervention: We included interventions that sought to improve academic skills, were conducted in schools during the regular school year, and were targeted (selected or indicated). Comparison: Included studies used an intervention-control group design or a comparison group design. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT); quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCT); and quasi-experimental studies (QES). Outcomes: Included studies used standardised tests in reading or mathematics. Setting: Studies carried out in regular schools in an OECD country were included. Data Collection and Analysis Descriptive and numerical characteristics of included studies were coded by members of the review team. A review author independently checked coding. We used an extended version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess risk of bias. We used random-effects meta-analysis and robust-variance estimation procedures to synthesise effect sizes. We conducted separate meta-analyses for tests performed within three months of the end of interventions (short-term effects) and longer follow-up periods. For short-term effects, we performed subgroup and moderator analyses focused on instructional methods and content domains. We assessed sensitivity of the results to effect size measurement, outliers, clustered assignment of treatment, risk of bias, missing moderator information, control group progression, and publication bias. Results We found in total 24,414 potentially relevant records, screened 4247 of them in full text, and included 607 studies that met the inclusion criteria. We included 205 studies of a wide range of intervention types in at least one meta-analysis (202 intervention-control studies and 3 comparison designs). The reasons for excluding studies from the analysis were that they had too high risk of bias (257), compared two alternative interventions (104 studies), lacked necessary information (24 studies), or used overlapping samples (17 studies). The total number of student observations in the analysed studies was 226,745. There were 93% RCTs among the 327 interventions we included in the meta-analysis of intervention-control contrasts and 86% were from the United States. The target group consisted of, on average, 45% girls, 65% minority students, and 69% low-income students. The mean Grade was 2.4. Most studies included in the meta-analysis had a moderate to high risk of bias. The overall average effect sizes (ES) for short-term and follow-up outcomes were positive and statistically significant (ES?=?0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?[0.25, 0.34] and ES?=?0.27, 95% CI?=?[0.17, 0.36]), respectively). The effect sizes correspond to around one third to one half of the achievement gap between fourth Grade students with high and low socioeconomic status in the United States and to a 58% chance that a randomly selected score of an intervention group student is greater than the score of a randomly selected control group student. All measures indicated substantial heterogeneity across short-term effect sizes. Follow-up outcomes pertain almost exclusively to studies examining small-group instruction by adults and effects on reading measures. The follow-up effect sizes were considerably less heterogeneous than the short-term effect sizes, although there was still statistically significant heterogeneity. Two instructional methods, peer-assisted instruction and small-group instruction by adults, had large and statistically significant average effect sizes that were robust across specifications in the subgroup analysis of short-term effects (ES around 0.35?0.45). In meta-regressions that adjusted for methods, content domains, and other study characteristics, they had significantly larger effect sizes than computer-assisted instruction, coaching of personnel, incentives, and progress monitoring. Peer-assisted instruction also had significantly larger effect sizes than medium-group instruction. Besides peer-assisted instruction and small-group instruction, no other methods were consistently significant across the analyses that tried to isolate the association between a specific method and effect sizes. However, most analyses showed statistically significant heterogeneity also within categories of instructional methods. We found little evidence that effect sizes were larger in some content domains than others. Fractions had significantly higher associations with effect sizes than all other math domains, but there were only six studies of interventions targeting fractions. We found no evidence of adverse effects in the sense that no method or domain had robustly negative associations with effect sizes. The meta-regressions revealed few other significant moderators. Interventions in higher Grades tend to have somewhat lower effect sizes, whereas there were no significant differences between QES and RCTs, general tests and tests of subdomains, and math tests and reading tests. Authors? Conclusions Our results indicate that interventions targeting students with or at risk of academic difficulties from kindergarten to Grade 6 have on average positive and statistically significant short-term and follow-up effects on standardised tests in reading and mathematics. Peer-assisted instruction and small-group instruction are likely to be effective components of such interventions. We believe the relatively large effect sizes together with the substantial unexplained heterogeneity imply that schools can reduce the achievement gap between students with or at risk of academic difficulties and not-at-risk students by implementing targeted interventions, and that more research into the design of effective interventions is needed.

N2  - Abstract Background The last two decades have seen a significant decrease in mortality for children <5 years of age in low and middle-income countries (LMICs); however, neonatal (age, 0?28 days) mortality has not decreased at the same rate. We assessed three neonatal nutritional interventions that have the potential of reducing morbidity and mortality during infancy in LMICs. Objectives To determine the efficacy and effectiveness of synthetic vitamin A, dextrose oral gel, and probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period. Search Methods We conducted electronic searches for relevant studies on the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL, Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, up to November 27, 2019. Selection Criteria We aimed to include randomized and quasi-experimental studies. The target population was neonates in LMICs. The interventions included synthetic vitamin A supplementation, oral dextrose gel supplementation, and probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period. We included studies from the community and hospital settings irrespective of the gestational age or birth weight of the neonate. Data Collection and Analysis Two authors screened the titles and extracted the data from selected studies. The risk of bias (ROB) in the included studies was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were neonatal sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), prevention and treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Data were meta-analyzed by random effect models to obtain relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The overall rating of evidence was determined by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main Results Sixteen randomized studies (total participants 169,366) assessed the effect of vitamin A supplementation during the neonatal period. All studies were conducted in low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries. Thirteen studies were conducted in the community setting and three studies were conducted in the hospital setting, specifically in neonatal intensive care units. Studies were conducted in 10 different countries including India (four studies), Guinea-Bissau (three studies), Bangladesh (two studies), and one study each in China, Ghana, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. The overall ROB was low in most of the included studies for neonatal vitamin A supplementation. The pooled results from the community based randomized studies showed that there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality in the vitamin A (intervention) group compared to controls at 1 month (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.90?1.08; six studies with 126,548 participants, statistical heterogeneity I2 0%, funnel plot symmetrical, grade rating high), 6 months (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89?1.07; 12 studies with 154,940 participants, statistical heterogeneity I2 43%, funnel plot symmetrical, GRADE quality high) and 12 months of age (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.94?1.14; eight studies with 118,376 participants, statistical heterogeneity I2 46%, funnel plot symmetrical, GRADE quality high). Neonatal vitamin A supplementation increased the incidence of bulging fontanelle by 53% compared to control (RR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.12?2.09; six studies with 100,256 participants, statistical heterogeneity I2 65%, funnel plot symmetrical, GRADE quality high). We did not identify any experimental study that addressed the use of dextrose gel for the prevention and/or treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia in LMIC. Thirty-three studies assessed the effect of probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period (total participants 11,595; probiotics: 5854 and controls: 5741). All of the included studies were conducted in LMIC and were randomized. Most of the studies were done in the hospital setting and included participants who were preterm (born?<?37 weeks gestation) and/or low birth weight (<2500?g birth weight). Studies were conducted in 13 different countries with 10 studies conducted in India, six studies in Turkey, three studies each in China and Iran, two each in Mexico and South Africa, and one each in Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Thailand. Three studies were at high ROB due to lack of appropriate randomization sequence or allocation concealment. Combined data from 25 studies showed that probiotic supplementation reduced all-cause mortality by 20% compared to controls (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66?0.96; total number of participants 10,998, number needed to treat 100, statistical heterogeneity I2 0%, funnel plot symmetrical, GRADE quality high). Twenty-nine studies reported the effect of probiotics on the incidence of NEC, and the combined results showed a relative reduction of 54% in the intervention group compared to controls (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.35?0.59; total number of participants 5574, number needed to treat 17, statistical heterogeneity I2 24%, funnel plot symmetrical, GRADE quality high). Twenty-one studies assessed the effect of probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period on neonatal sepsis, and the combined results showed a relative reduction of 22% in the intervention group compared to controls (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70?0.86; total number of participants 9105, number needed to treat 14, statistical heterogeneity I2 23%, funnel plot symmetrical, GRADE quality high). Authors' Conclusions Vitamin A supplementation during the neonatal period does not reduce all-cause neonatal or infant mortality in LMICs in the community setting. However, neonatal vitamin A supplementation increases the risk of Bulging Fontanelle. No experimental or quasi-experimental studies were available from LMICs to assess the effect of dextrose gel supplementation for the prevention or treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period seems to reduce all-cause mortality, NEC, and sepsis in babies born with low birth weight and/or preterm in the hospital setting. There was clinical heterogeneity in the use of probiotics, and we could not recommend any single strain of probiotics for wider use based on these results. There was a lack of studies on probiotic supplementation in the community setting. More research is needed to assess the effect of probiotics administered to neonates in-home/community setting in LMICs.

N2  - Abstract Background The Campbell Collaboration undertakes systematic reviews of the effects of social and economic policies (interventions) to help policymakers, practitioners, and the public to make well-informed decisions about policy interventions. In 2010, the Cochrane Collaboration and the Campbell Collaboration developed a voluntary co-registration policy under the rationale to make full use of the shared interests and diverse expertise from different review groups within these two organizations. In order to promote the methodological quality and transparency of Campbell intervention reviews, the Methodological Expectations of Campbell Collaboration Intervention Reviews (MECCIR) were introduced in 2014 to guide Campbell reviewers. However, there has not been a comprehensive review of the methodological quality and reporting characteristics of Campbell reviews. Objectives This review aimed to assess the methodological and reporting characteristics of Campbell intervention reviews and to compare the methodological quality and reporting completeness of Campbell reviews published before and after the implementation of MECCIR. A secondary aim was to compare the methodological quality and reporting completeness of reviews registered with Campbell only versus those co-registered with Cochrane and Campbell. Search Methods We searched the Campbell Library to identify all the completed intervention reviews published between 1 January 2011 to 31 January 2018. Selection Criteria One researcher downloaded and screened all the records to exclude non-intervention reviews based on reviews? title and abstract. A second researcher checked the full text of all the excluded records to confirm the exclusion. In case of discrepancies, the two researchers jointly agreed on the final decision. Data Collection and Analysis We developed the abstraction form based on mandatory reporting items for methods, results, and discussion from the MECCIR reporting standards Version 1.1; and additional epidemiological characteristics identified in a similar study of systematic reviews in health. Additionally, we judged the methodological quality and completeness of reporting of each included review. For methodological quality, we used the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2) instrument; for reporting completeness we used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. We rated reporting as either complete/partial or not reported. We described characteristics of the included reviews with frequencies and percentages, and median with interquartile ranges (IQRs). We used Stata version 12.0 to conduct multiple linear regressions for continuous data and the ordered logistic regressions for ordered data to investigate associations between prespecified factors and both methodological quality and completeness of reporting. Main Results We included 96 Campbell reviews, 46 were published between January 2011 and September 2014 (pre-MECCIR) and 50 between October 2014 and January 2018 (post-MECCIR). Twenty-two of 96 (23%) reviews were co-registered with Cochrane. For overall methodological quality, 16 (17%) reviews were rated as high, 40 (42%) as moderate, 24 (25%) as low and 16 (17%) as critical low using AMSTAR 2. Reviews published after the release of MECCIR had better methodological quality ratings than those published before MECCIR (odds ratio [OR]? ?=6.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] [2.86, 15.27], p?<?.001). The percentages of reviews of high or moderate quality were 76% (post-MECCIR) and 39% (pre-MECCIR). Reviews co-registered with Cochrane were rated as having better methodological quality than those registered only with Campbell (OR?=?5.57, 95% CI [2.13, 14.58], p?<?.001). The percentages of reviews of high or moderate quality were 77% versus 53% between co-registered and Campbell registered only reviews. Twenty-five of 96 reviews (26%) completely or partially reported all 27 PRISMA checklist items. The median number of items reported across reviews was 25 (IQR, 22?26). Reviews published after the release of MECCIR reported 2.80 more items than those published before MECCIR (95% CI [1.74, 3.88], p?<?.001); reviews co-registered on Campbell and Cochrane reported 1.98 more items than reviews only registered in Campbell (95% CI [0.72, 3.24], p?=?.003). An increasing trend over time was observed for both the percentage of high and moderate methodological quality of reviews and the median number of PRISMA items reported. Authors' Conclusions Many features expected in systematic reviews were present in Campbell reviews most of the time. Methodological quality and reporting completeness were both significantly higher in reviews published after the introduction of MECCIR in 2014 compared with those published before. However, this may also reflect general improvement in the reporting the methodology of systematic reviews over time or associations with other characteristics which were not assessed such as funding or experience of teams. Reviews co-registered with Cochrane were of higher methodological quality and more complete reporting than reviews only registered in Campbell.

N2  - Abstract Background The increasing imbalance between the number of older adults not working and the number of adults in the age range of labour force participation (age range 20?64) has long been a fundamental public policy challenge in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries. At a societal level, this growing imbalance raises serious concerns about the viability and funding of social security, pensions and health programmes. At an individual level, the concern is probably more that of aging well with the prospect of many years in retirement. Some research suggests that retiring for some carries the risk of a fast decline in health. Volunteering can play a significant role in people's lives as they transition from work to retirement, as it offers a ?structured? means of making a meaningful contribution in society once the opportunity to do so through work has been cut off. Some older people consider voluntary work as a way to replicate aspects of paid work lost upon retirement, such as organisational structure and time discipline. In many countries, volunteering of the older adults is increasing and programmes designed specifically for this subpopulation are emerging. Volunteering may contribute to both individuals aging well and society aging well, as volunteering by the older adults at the same time relieves the societal burden if it helps maintain health and functionality for those who volunteer. It thus remains to be established to what extent volunteering impacts on the physical and mental health of those who volunteer. Objectives The main objective of this review is to answer the following research question: what are the effects of volunteering on the physical and mental health of people aged 65 years or older? Search Strategy Relevant studies were identified through electronic searches of bibliographic databases, governmental and grey literature repositories, hand search in specific targeted journals, citation tracking, contact to international experts and internet search engines. The database searches were carried out to December 2018 and other resources were searched in September 2019 and October 2019. We searched to identify both published and unpublished literature. The searches were international in scope. Reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews were also searched. Selection Criteria The intervention of interest was formal volunteering which can be described as voluntary, on-going, planned, helping behaviour that intend to increase the well-being of strangers, offers no monetary compensation and typically occurs within an organisational context. We included older people aged 65 or over who are engaged in formal voluntary work. The primary focus was on measures of physical and mental health. All study designs that used a well-defined control group were eligible for inclusion. Studies that utilised qualitative approaches were not included. Data Collection and Analysis The total number of potential relevant studies constituted 17,046 hits. A total of 90 studies, met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised by the review authors. The 90 studies analysed 47 different populations. Only 26 studies (analysing 19 different populations) could be used in the data synthesis. Forty-six studies could not be used in the data synthesis as they were judged to have too high risk of bias and, in accordance with the protocol, were excluded from the meta-analysis on the basis that they would be more likely to mislead than inform. Eighteen studies did not provide enough information enabling us to calculate an effects size and standard error or did not provide results in a form enabling us to use it in the data synthesis. Finally, of the 26 studies that could be used in the data synthesis, two pairs of studies used the same two data sets and reported on the same outcome(s), thus in addition two studies were not used in the data synthesis. Meta-analysis of both physical health outcomes and mental health outcomes were conducted on each metric separately. All analyses were inverse variance weighted using random effects statistical models that incorporate both the sampling variance and between study variance components into the study level weights. Random effects weighted mean effect sizes were calculated using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analysis was carried out by restricting the meta-analysis to a subset of all studies included in the original meta-analysis and was used to evaluate whether the pooled effect sizes were robust across components of risk of bias. Results The 24 studies (analysing 19 different populations), used for meta analysis were from Australia, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea and United States, three were a randomised controlled trial and 21 were NRS. The baseline time period (the year the voluntary work that was analysed was measured) spanned by the included studies is 30 years, from 1984 to 2014 and on average the baseline year was 2001. On average the number of follow up years was 5, although with great variation from 0 to 25 years. The average number of volunteers analysed (not reported in four studies) was 2,369, ranging from 15 to 27,131 and the average number of controls was 13,581, ranging from 13 to 217.297. In total the average number of participants analysed was 14,566, ranging from 28 to 244.428. Ten studies analysed the effect of voluntary work on mortality, however, eight studies reported a hazard ratio and two studies reported an odds ratio. We analysed these two types of effect sizes separately. A hazard ratio <1 indicates that the treated, the volunteers is favoured. That is, the conditional mortality rate is lower for volunteers. All reported results indicated an effect favouring the volunteers, primary study effect sizes lied in the range 0.67?0.91. The random effects weighted mean hazard ratio was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72?0.80) and statistically significant. The two studies that reported odds ratios of mortality supported this result. There was no heterogeneity between the studies in either of the meta analyses. Three studies analysed the effect of voluntary work on incident functional disability, using a hazard ratio as effect measure. All reported results indicated an effect favouring the volunteers, primary study effect sizes lied in the range 0.70?0.99. The random effects weighted mean hazard ratio was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72?0.97) and statistically significant. There was a small amount of heterogeneity between the studies. Two studies analysed the effect of voluntary work on decline in instrumental activities of daily living, using an odds ratio as effect measure. Both reported results indicated an effect favouring the volunteers (0.63 and 0.83). The random effects weighted mean odds ratio was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.53?1.01) and not statistically significant. There is no heterogeneity between the two studies. Three studies analysed the effect of voluntary work on maintenance of functional competence, using an odds ratio as effect measure. All reported results indicated an effect favouring the volunteers, primary study effect sizes lied in the range 0.67?0.83. The random effects weighted mean odds ratio was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70?0.94) and statistically significant. There is no heterogeneity between the studies. In addition a number of other physical outcomes were reported in a single study only. Three studies analysed the effect of voluntary work on depression, and reported results that enabled the calculation of standardised mean difference (SMD) and variance. The effect sizes are measured such that a positive effect size favours the volunteers. All reported results indicated an effect favouring the volunteers, primary study effect sizes lied in the range 0.05?0.66. The random effects weighted SMD was 0.12 (95% CI, 0.00?0.23) and statistically significant. There is a very small amount of heterogeneity between the studies. In addition, a number of other mental health outcomes were reported in a single study only. We did not find any adverse effects. There were no appreciable changes in the results across components of risk of bias as indicated by the sensitivity analysis. Authors' Conclusions The review aimed to examine effects on all types of physical and mental health outcomes. With the exception of mortality, there was insufficient evidence available. The available evidence, however, does suggest that there is an effect on the mortality of volunteers, although the effect is small. We found evidence that voluntary work reduces the mortality hazard of the volunteers aged 65 and above. The effect corresponds to a 43% chance of the volunteers dying first which should be compared to a fifty-fifty chance (50%) of dying first if the intervention had no effect. The evidence seems robust in the sense that we did not find any heterogeneity between the studies. As the intervention, unlike most other interventions in the social welfare area, is not costly, it could be prescribed to more older adults. In fact as the intervention in contrary to carrying a cost is a productive activity contributing directly to community well-being and has a positive effect on the volunteers it probably should be prescribed universally. However, due to the very nature of the intervention, it is voluntary and it cannot be prescribed. But more people could be encouraged to take up voluntary work if the opportunity was immediately available and visible.

N2  - Abstract Background Road traffic crashes are a major and increasing cause of injury and death around the world. In 2015, there were almost 6.3 million motor vehicle traffic crashes in the United States. Of these, approximately 1.7 million (27%) involved some form of injury and 32,166 (0.5%) resulted in one or more fatalities (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2016, Traffic Safety Facts 2013: A Compilation of Motor Vehicle Crash Data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and the General Estimates System). The most common cause of urban crashes appears to be drivers running red lights or ignoring other traffic controls and injuries occur in 39% of all of these types of crashes (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, IIHS, 2018, Red light running). While many drivers obey traffic signals, the possibility for violations exists due to issues such as driver distraction, aggressive driving behaviors, or a deliberate decision to ignore the traffic signal. One researcher suggests that eliminating traffic violations could reduce road injury crashes by up to 40% (Zaal, 1994, Traffic law enforcement: A review of the literature). Red light cameras (RLCs) are an enforcement mechanism that permit police to remotely enforce traffic signals; they may serve as a deterrent to drivers who intentionally engage in red light running (RLR). The one previous systematic review of RLCs found that they were effective in reducing total casualty crashes but also found that evidence on the effectiveness of cameras on red light violations, total crashes, or specific types of casualty crashes was inconclusive. However, this review searched only a small number of electronic databases and was limited to a handful of studies published in 2002 or earlier. Objectives This report updates and expands upon the previous Cochrane systematic review of RLCs. The aim of this review is to systematically review and synthesize the available evidence on the effectiveness of RLCs on the incidence of red light violations and the incidence and severity of various types of traffic crashes. Search Methods This study uses a four-part search strategy that involves: (a) searching 27 online electronic bibliographic databases for published and unpublished evaluations of RLCs; (b) searching the websites of 46 international institutes and research agencies focusing on transportation issues for reports and other gray literature; (c) searching the reference lists of published studies to identify additional published and unpublished works; and (d) conducting a keyword search using Google and Google Scholar to search for additional gray literature. Selection Criteria The criteria for inclusion were determined before the search process began. To be eligible, studies must have assessed the impact of RLCs on red light violations and/or traffic crashes. Studies must have employed a quantitative research design that involved randomized controlled trials, quasi-random controlled trials, a controlled before-after design, or a controlled interrupted time series. Research that incorporated additional interventions, such as speed cameras or enhanced police enforcement, were excluded, although normal routine traffic enforcement in the nonintervention control condition was not excluded. Both published and unpublished reports were included. Studies were eligible regardless of the country in which they were conducted or the date of publication. Qualitative, observational, or descriptive studies that did not include formal comparisons of treatment and control groups were excluded from this research. Data Collection and Analysis Initial searches produced a total of 5,708 references after duplicates were removed. After title and abstract screening, a total of 121 references remained. Full-text review of these works identified 28 primary studies meeting the inclusion criteria, in addition to the 10 studies identified in the prior Cochrane review. Because several of the primary studies reported on multiple independent study areas, this report evaluates 41 separate analyses. At least two review authors independently assessed all records for eligibility, assessed methodological risk of bias, and extracted data from the full-text reports; disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third review author. To facilitate comparisons between studies, a standardized summary measure based on relative effects, rather than differences in effects, was defined for each outcome. Summary measures were calculated for all studies when possible. When at least three studies reported the same outcome, the results were pooled in a meta-analysis. Pooled meta-analyses were carried out when at least three studies reported the same outcome; otherwise, the results of individual studies were described in a narrative. Heterogeneity among effect estimates was assessed using ?2 tests at a 5% level of significance and quantified using the I2 statistic. EMMIE framework data were coded using the EPPIE Reviewer database. Results The results of this systematic review suggest that RLCs are associated with a statistically significant reduction in crash outcomes, although this varies by type of crash, and suggest a reduction in red light violations. RLCs are associated with a a 20% decrease in total injury crashes, a 24% decrease in right angle crashes and a 29% decrease in right angle injury crashes. Conversely, however, RLCs are also associated with a statistically significant increase in rear end crashes of 19%. There was also some evidence that RLCs were associated with a large reduction in crashes due to red light violations. There is no evidence to suggest that study heterogeneity is consistently explained by either country or risk of bias, nor did the presence or absence of warning signs appear to impact the effectiveness of RLCs. Studies accounting for regression to the mean tend to report more moderate decreases for right angle crashes resulting in injury than studies not accounting for regression to the mean. Studies with better control for confounders reported a nonsignificant decrease in right angle crashes, compared with a significant decrease for all studies. Authors' Conclusions The evidence suggests that RLCs may be effective in reducing red light violations and are likely to be effective in reducing some types of traffic crashes, although they also appear linked to an increase in rear end crashes. Several implications for policymakers and practitioners have emerged from this research. The costs and benefits of RLCs must be considered when implementing RLC programs. The potential benefits of a reduction in traffic violations and in some types of injury crashes must be weighed against the increased risk of other crash types. The economic implications of operating an RLC program also must be considered, including the costs of installation and operation as well as the economic impact of RLC effects.

N2  - Abstract Background Malnutrition is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents and is now considered to be one of the largest risk factors responsible for the global burden of diseases along with poor diet. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the impact of preventive nutrition interventions (including nutrition education and counselling; micronutrient supplementation/fortification and macronutrient supplementation) to improve the health and nutritional status of adolescents aged 10?19 years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The secondary objective of the review was to assess various contextual factors based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) health system building blocks framework that might potentially impact the effectiveness of these interventions for this age group. Search Methods The search was conducted on Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the WHO nutrition databases, CAB Global Health, Social Science Citation Index, Scopus, WHO Global Health Index, ADOLEC and EPPI until February 5, 2019. We searched Google Scholar along with key nutrition agencies database such as Nutrition International, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, the World Food Programme and HarvestPlus to search for nonindexed, grey literature to locate relevant programme evaluations and any additional trials. All searches were performed without any restrictions on publication date, language or publication status. Selection Criteria We included randomised controlled trials, quasiexperimental studies, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series evaluating the effectiveness of preventive nutrition interventions among adolescents between 10 and 19 years of age from LMICs. Data Collection and Analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies. Meta-analysis was conducted separately for each outcome and intervention. For dichotomous data, we reported risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, we reported the mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. Main Results This review summarises findings from a total of 10 studies from 15 papers including 10,802 participants. All the studies included in this review assessed the impact of micronutrient supplementation/fortification on health and nutritional status among adolescents in LMIC. We did not find any study assessing the impact of nutrition education and counselling or on macronutrient supplementation among adolescents. Micronutrient supplementation/fortification interventions included calcium/vitamin D supplementation/fortification, iron supplementation with or without folic acid, zinc supplementation and multiple micronutrient (MMN) fortification. The majority of the studies (eight out of 10 studies) included adolescent girls aged between 10 and 19 years of age. We did not find any large scale preventive nutrition intervention programmes targeting adolescents in LMICs. We are uncertain of the effect of iron supplementation with or without folic acid on anaemia (daily supplementation; RR: 1.04, 95% CI 0.88, 1.24; one study; 1,160 participants; low quality evidence. Weekly supplementation; RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.26; one study; 1,247 participants; low quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of various micronutrient supplementation/fortification on body mass index (calcium/vitamin D supplementation; (MD: ?0.01?kg/m2; 95% CI: ?1.20, 1.17; two studies; 730 participants; I2 94%; very low quality evidence, iron supplementation with or without folic acid; MD: 0.29?kg/m2; 95% CI: ?0.25, 0.83; two studies; 652 participants; I2 69%; very low quality evidence, zinc supplementation; MD: 0.35?kg/m2; 95% CI: ?0.15, 0.85; one study; 382 participants; very low quality evidence) and MMN fortification; MD: 0.23?kg/m2, 95% CI: ?0.11, 0.57; two studies; 943 participants; I2 22%; very low quality evidence). None of the included studies reported any other primary outcomes including morbidity or adverse effects. Iron supplementation with or without folic acid may improve haemoglobin concentrations (MD: 0.42?g/dL, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.71; four studies; 1,020 participants; I2 89%; low quality evidence). Calcium/vitamin D supplementation may improve serum 25(OH) D levels (standardised mean difference [SMD]: 2.85, 95% CI: 0.89, 4.82; two studies; 395 participants; I2 99%; low quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of calcium only supplementation (MD: 0.02?g/cm2, 95% CI: ?0.00, 0.04; one study; 233 participants; low quality outcome) and calcium?+?vitamin D supplementation (MD: 0.02?g/cm2, 95% CI: ?0.00, 0.04; one study; 235 participants; low quality evidence) on total bone mineral density (BMD). We are uncertain of the effect of MMN fortification on haemoglobin concentrations (MD: ?0.10?g/dL, 95% CI: ?0.88, 0.68; two studies; 1102 participants; I2 100%; very low quality evidence); calcium supplementation on total body bone mineral content (BMC); (MD: 30.20?g, 95% CI: ?40.56, 100.96; one study; 233 participants; low quality evidence), calcium?+?vitamin D supplementation on total body BMC (MD: 21.60?g, 95% CI: ?45.32, 88.52; one study; 235 participants; low quality evidence) and zinc supplementation on serum zinc levels (SMD: 6.94, 95% CI: ?4.84, 18.71; two studies; 494 participants; very low quality evidence). One study reported the impact of iron supplementation with or without folic acid on cognition of adolescent girls suggesting improved cognition in most of the tests with daily or twice weekly supplementation compared to once weekly or no supplementation. None of the other secondary outcomes were reported including any other development outcomes and all-cause mortality. These findings warrant caution while interpreting due to very few studies and high heterogeneity. Authors' Conclusions There is limited evidence of micronutrient supplementation/fortification among adolescents on health and nutritional status in LMICs, with lack of evidence on nutrition education and counselling and macronutrient supplementation. The findings are generaliseable for adolescent girls since all studies (except one) targeted female adolescents.
