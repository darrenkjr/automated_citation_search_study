Impostor syndrome among physicians and physicians in training: A scoping review.,"CONTEXT: Impostor syndrome (IS) is increasingly recognised as a condition among physicians and physicians in training. Impostor syndrome is especially problematic because of its association with increased rates of burnout and suicide. In order to address this issue, we need to fully understand its prevalence, scope, and factors associated with IS. The purpose of this scoping review is to analyse the existing literature on IS among practising physicians and physicians in training in order to identify current trends and directions for future research. METHODS: The authors conducted a literature search of nine databases for any articles on IS among practising physicians or physicians in training published prior to January 2019. Two reviewers independently screened articles and identified 18 papers meeting the study inclusion criteria. Two authors independently extracted data and performed quantitative and qualitative syntheses consistent with best practice recommendations for scoping reviews. RESULTS: Most studies utilised the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale and cited rates of IS ranging from 22% to 60%. Studies found that gender, low self-esteem and institutional culture were associated with higher rates of IS, whereas social support, validation of success, positive affirmation, and both personal and shared reflections were protective. Overall, IS was also associated with higher rates of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarises the existing literature on IS among practising physicians and physicians in training, providing valuable insights and areas for future research.",10.1111/medu.13956,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Trends in guideline implementation: an updated scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines aim toÂ support evidence-informed practice but are inconsistently used without implementationÂ strategies. Our prior scoping review revealed that guideline implementation interventions were not selected and tailored based on processes known to enhance guideline uptake and impact. The purpose of this study was to update the prior scoping review. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies published from 2014 to January 2021 that evaluated guideline implementation interventions. We screened studies in triplicate and extracted data in duplicate. We reported study and intervention characteristics and studies that achieved impact with summary statistics. RESULTS: We included 118 studies that implemented guidelines on 16 clinical topics. With regard to implementation planning, 21% of studies referred to theories or frameworks, 50% pre-identified implementation barriers, and 36% engaged stakeholders in selecting or tailoring interventions. Studies that employed frameworks (n=25) most often used the theoretical domains framework (28%) or social cognitive theory (28%). Those that pre-identified barriers (n=59) most often consulted literature (60%). Those that engaged stakeholders (n=42) most often consulted healthcare professionals (79%). Common interventions included educating professionals about guidelines (44%) and information systems/technology (41%). Most studies employed multi-faceted interventions (75%). A total of 97 (82%) studies achieved impact (improvements in one or more reported outcomes) including 10 (40% of 25) studies that employed frameworks, 28 (47.45% of 59) studies that pre-identified barriers, 22 (52.38% of 42) studies that engaged stakeholders, and 21 (70% of 30) studies that employed single interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to our prior review, this review found that more studies used processes to select and tailor interventions, and a wider array of types of interventions across the Mazza taxonomy. Given that most studies achieved impact, this might reinforce the need for implementation planning. However, even studies that did not plan implementation achieved impact. Similarly, even single interventions achieved impact. Thus, a future systematic review based on this data is warranted to establish if the use of frameworks, barrier identification, stakeholder engagement, and multi-faceted interventions are associated with impact. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol was registered with Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/4nxpr ) and published in JBI Evidence Synthesis.",10.1186/s13012-022-01223-6,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
A scoping review of pharmacy participation in dental and oral health care.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the scope of dental and oral health care (DOHC) provided by the pharmacy profession and associated outcomes, and attitudes of pharmacy staff and other key stakeholders about pharmacy involvement in this context. METHODS: A scoping review of full-text articles describing outcomes related to pharmacy staff/student involvement in, knowledge of or attitudes towards DOHC in any setting, and stakeholder perspectives was conducted. Articles written in English were searched for using PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Education Resources Information Centre, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ProQuest for Dissertations and Theses. No date restrictions were used. Key outcomes were mapped: role and practice, knowledge and attitudes, and training and education. RESULTS: Seventy studies met the inclusion criteria: 49 were conducted in developed countries; 60 were quantitative in design; and 38 involved community pharmacy settings only. Pharmacists and pharmacy support staff commonly managed DOHC inquiries (nÂ =Â 13), including the provision of advice and products with or without a further referral. Integrated pharmacist-led services in dental settings (nÂ =Â 4) showed improved prescribing and quality use of medicines but low community pharmacy referrals were identified in studies involving mystery shoppers with potential oral cancer (nÂ =Â 7). DOHC promotion programmes delivered by pharmacy staff and collaborations with dentists were limited. There was interest from the pharmacy profession for a role in DOHC; however, knowledge gaps were reported and needs for further training identified. Consumer participant DOHC outcomes were not reported. CONCLUSIONS: Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were interested in an expanded role in DOHC; however, this scoping review identified lack of knowledge and sub-optimal practice as potential barriers. Research on development, implementation and evaluation of DOHC-related services and practice by pharmacy staff was scarce. Further evidence of consumer-related oral health outcomes and their perceptions of the role of pharmacy is needed.",10.1111/cdoe.12651,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Climate Change and Mental Health: A Scoping Review.,"Climate change is negatively impacting the mental health of populations. This scoping review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change and mental health across the World Health Organisation's (WHO) five global research priorities for protecting human health from climate change. We conducted a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental health and climate change using online academic databases. We assessed the quality of studies where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identified 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative (n = 67), cross-sectional (n = 42), conducted in high-income countries (n = 87), and concerned with the first of the WHO global research priorities-assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change (n = 101). Several climate-related exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods were associated with psychological distress, worsened mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. Few studies (n = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate change (effective interventions (n = 8); mitigation and adaptation (n = 7); improving decision-support (n = 3); and cost estimations (n = 1)). While climate change and mental health represents a rapidly growing area of research, it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.",10.3390/ijerph18094486,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Scoping Review of Self-Advocacy Education Interventions to Improve Care.,"Self-advocacy is a client's ability to represent one's interests when managing disease or disability. Self-advocacy may increase one's ability to seek, evaluate, and use information to promote health, yet little is known about the role of occupational therapy in promoting self-advocacy. This scoping review aims to identify interventions within occupational therapists' scope of practice to improve self-advocacy. A literature search was conducted through Academic Search Complete to identify interventions within the scope of occupational therapy that promote self-advocacy. All levels of evidence were included, and articles were reviewed for inclusion by two authors. Included articles were charted for level of evidence, objectives, participants, and results. Fourteen articles met the criteria. Interventions included interactive multimedia interventions, peer-led educational groups, writing interventions, job counseling and advocacy, and disease-specific advocacy programs. Occupational therapists are well-equipped to intervene and promote self-advocacy through workplace modification, utilizing assistive technologies, and facilitating peer-led educational groups.",10.1177/1539449219860583,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
The Isolated Surgeon: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND: Surgeons in resource-limited environments often provide care outside the expected scope of current general surgery training. Geographically isolated patients may be unwilling or unable to travel for specialty care. These same patients also present with life-threatening emergencies beyond the typical breadth of a general surgeon's practice, in hospitals with limited professional and material support. This review characterizes the unique role of isolated surgeons, so individual surgeons and health care organizations may focus professional development resources more efficiently, with the ultimate goal of improved patient care. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of the isolated surgeon, reviewing 25Â years of literature regarding isolated US civilian and military surgeons. We examined emerging themes regarding the definition of an isolated surgeon, the scope of surgical practice beyond current training norms, and training gaps identified by surgeons in an isolated role. RESULTS: From 904 articles identified, we included 91 for final review. No prior definition exists for the isolated surgeon, although multiple definitions describe rural surgeons, patients, or hospitals; we propose an initial definition from consistent themes in the literature. Isolated surgeons across varied practice settings consistently performed relatively large volumes of cases of, and identified training gaps in, orthopedic, obstetric and gynecologic, urologic, and vascular surgery subspecialties. Life-threatening, ""rare-but-real"" cases in the above and neurosurgical disciplines are uncommon, but consistent across practice settings. CONCLUSIONS: This review represents the largest examination of the isolated surgeon in the current literature. Clarifying the identity, practice components, and training gaps of the isolated surgeon represent the first step in formalizing support for this small but critical group of surgeons and their patients.",10.1016/j.jss.2020.12.032,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Scoping review - What do we know about Aboriginal peoples' use of dose administration aids?,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: This paper aims to report findings of a scoping review which mapped and summarised available literature regarding Aboriginal peoples' use of Dose Administration Aids (DAAs) for improved medication management. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have higher rates of chronic disease than other Australians. This leads to increased numbers of prescribed medications and complex medication taking regimens. The Australian Government and Pharmacy Bodies provide programs for Aboriginal peoples with chronic conditions, including programs supporting access to DAAs to improve medication adherence. METHODS: The search strings used included three key concepts: Indigeneity; DAAs and outcomes. PubMed, Medline via Ovid and the grey literature were searched. RESULTS: After removal of duplicates, 426 papers were screened by title and abstract for inclusion. A further 407 papers were then excluded leaving a total of nineteen papers included in the review. Only three of these papers included all three concepts in the search criteria, and none of these were empirical studies. CONCLUSION: The lack of studies found in this review support the requirement for empirical research regarding the effects of DAAs on medication taking behaviours of Aboriginal people, and the programs that provide them. SO WHAT?: The Australian Government funds programs that provides access to DAAs as a method of improving medication taking behaviours. But what do we really know about DAAs and if or how they assist in this goal? This review scopes out what is known, in order to direct studies that will answer this question.",10.1002/hpja.577,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Health Literacy in Neurosurgery: A Scoping Review.,"OBJECTIVE: Low health literacy is prevalent and associated with suboptimal health outcomes. In neurosurgery, social determinants of health are increasingly recognized as factors underpinning outcomes, as well as access to and use of care. We conducted a scoping review to delineate the scope of existing literature regarding health literacy in the field and facilitate future research. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance. Studies meeting prespecified inclusion criteria underwent full text review. Relevant data were extracted. RESULTS: Of 5056 resultant articles, 57 manuscripts were included. Thirty-seven studies (64.9%) investigated personal health literacy, while the remaining 20 (35.1%) investigated organizational health literacy. Domains of health literacy investigated were science (36, 63.2%), fundamental (20, 35.1%), and civic (1, 1.7%). No studies investigated numeracy. Recall among patients after discussions with neurosurgeons is low. Patient perspectives are often erroneous. Patient informational needs are often unmet. Written patient educational materials are written at a level too complex for the average patients. Videos are mostly of poor quality. Multimodal audiovisual interventions, eBooks, models, and virtual reality are shown to be effective methods for promoting recall. CONCLUSIONS: Studies examining health literacy in neurosurgery primarily focus on the topic indirectly, most often via written educational materials and recall after educational interventions. Increasing awareness of health literacy among neurosurgeons, assessing health literacy, and incorporating health literacy-informed counseling approaches are warranted to improve patient care.",10.1016/j.wneu.2022.07.023,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Hospital falls prevention with patient education: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Hospital falls remain a frequent and debilitating problem worldwide. Most hospital falls prevention strategies have targeted clinician education, environmental modifications, assistive devices, hospital systems and medication reviews. The role that patients can play in preventing falls whilst in hospital has received less attention. This critical review scopes patient falls education interventions for hospitals. The quality of the educational designs under-pinning patient falls education programmes was also evaluated. The outcomes of patient-centred falls prevention programs were considered for a range of hospital settings and diagnoses. METHODS: The Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework for scoping reviews was adapted using Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Eight databases, including grey literature, were searched from January 2008 until February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the articles and data were extracted and summarised thematically. The quality of falls prevention education programs for patients was also appraised using a modified quality metric tool. RESULTS: Forty-three articles were included in the final analysis. The interventions included: (i) direct face-to-face patient education about falls risks and mitigation; (ii) educational tools; (iii) patient-focussed consumer materials such as pamphlets, brochures and handouts; and (iv) hospital systems, policies and procedures to assist patients to prevent falls. The included studies assessed falls or education related outcomes before and after patient falls prevention education. Few studies reported incorporating education design principles or educational theories. When reported, most educational programs were of low to moderate quality from an educational design perspective. CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging evidence that hospital falls prevention interventions that incorporate patient education can reduce falls and associated injuries such as bruising, lacerations or fractures. The design, mode of delivery and quality of educational design influence outcomes. Well-designed education programs can improve knowledge and self-perception of risk, empowering patients to reduce their risk of falling whilst in hospital.",10.1186/s12877-020-01515-w,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Scoping Review on the Multimodal Classification of Depression and Experimental Study on Existing Multimodal Models.,"Depression is a prevalent comorbidity in patients with severe physical disorders, such as cancer, stroke, and coronary diseases. Although it can significantly impact the course of the primary disease, the signs of depression are often underestimated and overlooked. The aim of this paper was to review algorithms for the automatic, uniform, and multimodal classification of signs of depression from human conversations and to evaluate their accuracy. For the scoping review, the PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews were followed. In the scoping review, the search yielded 1095 papers, out of which 20 papers (8.26%) included more than two modalities, and 3 of those papers provided codes. Within the scope of this review, supported vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and long short-term memory network (LSTM; with gated and non-gated recurrent units) models, as well as different combinations of features, were identified as the most widely researched techniques. We tested the models using the DAIC-WOZ dataset (original training dataset) and using the SymptomMedia dataset to further assess their reliability and dependency on the nature of the training datasets. The best performance was obtained by the LSTM with gated recurrent units (F1-score of 0.64 for the DAIC-WOZ dataset). However, with a drop to an F1-score of 0.56 for the SymptomMedia dataset, the method also appears to be the most data-dependent.",10.3390/diagnostics12112683,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Scoping review: Scope of practice of nurse-led services and access to care for people experiencing homelessness.,"AIMS: To investigate the scope of practice of nurse-led services for people experiencing homelessness, and the influence on access to healthcare. DESIGN: A scoping review. DATA SOURCES: On 20 November 2020, the following databases were searched: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Scopus. REVIEW METHODS: Included studies focused on people experiencing homelessness aged 18â€‰years and over, nurse-led services in any setting and described the nursing scope of practice. Studies were peer-reviewed primary research, published in English from the year 2000. Three authors performed quality appraisals using the mixed methods assessment tool. Results were synthesized and discussed narratively and reported according to the PRISMA-ScR 2020 Statement. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included from the United States (nÂ =â€‰9), Australia (nÂ =â€‰4), United Kingdom (nÂ =â€‰4) and Canada (nÂ =â€‰2). The total participant sample size was nÂ =â€‰6303. Studies focused on registered nurses (nÂ =â€‰10), nurse practitioners (nÂ =â€‰5) or both (nÂ =â€‰4), in outpatient or community settings. The nursing scope of practice was broad and covered a range of skills, knowledge and attributes. Key skills identified include assessment and procedural skills, client support and health education. Key attributes were a trauma-informed approach and building trust through communication. Important knowledge included understanding the impact of homelessness, knowledge of available services and the capacity to undertake holistic assessments. Findings suggest that nurse-led care facilitated access to healthcare through building trust and supporting clients to access services. CONCLUSION: Optimized nursing scope of practice can facilitate access to healthcare for people experiencing homelessness. Key factors in enabling this include autonomy in nursing practice, organizational support and education. IMPACT: The broad range of skills, knowledge and attributes reported provide a foundation from which to design an educational framework to optimize the nursing scope of practice, thereby increasing access to healthcare for people experiencing homelessness.",10.1111/jan.15387,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
A Scoping Review on the Experience of Participating in Dignity Therapy for Adults at the End of Life.,"Background: As the proportion of aging population is increasing, so is the need for palliative care services. The end of life is marked by suffering and currently it is not well addressed in palliative care. Dignity therapy (DT) is one of the most popular therapies aimed at reducing suffering at the life and yet the quantitative evidence supporting its effectiveness is mixed. Also, no study has looked extensively at the qualitative literature. Objective: To describe the experience of participating in DT for adults in end of life. Design: A scoping review was conducted on the experience of DT among adults at their end of life. We searched electronic databases between 2002 and 2020. Two reviewers independently screened, extracted, and coded the data. They were analyzed using a thematic framework approach. Results: Twelve articles were included in the final analysis and were published between 2010 and 2019. The articles originated from the United States (3), Canada (3), Poland (2), Australia (2), the United Kingdom (2), Italy (1), and Germany (1). Two main categories of themes emerged from our analysis: themes mentioned during the DT intervention and themes following the DT intervention. The primary themes found during the DT intervention are discussions relating to the end of life, reflection on life, and creating a life narrative. The themes found following the DT intervention are that it opened a reflection on the past, that this was a helpful intervention, and that it was difficult, but important. Conclusions: Few qualitative studies assessed the experience of participating in DT following the intervention. This gap in the literature could explain the difficulties we currently have in understanding the effects of DT. Future studies should aim to assess how the effects of DT are perceived by patients after the intervention.",10.1089/jpm.2021.0498,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
A scoping review of child grooming strategies: pre- and post-internet.,"BACKGROUND: Researchers have studied the online sexual grooming of minors extensively since the early 2000s. However, the grooming process is neither new nor restricted to digital media. While grooming and child sexual abuse existed long before the Internet, the advent of the Internet has resulted in more ways in which offenders can interact with candidate victims including offline-only, online-only, and a mix of offline and online. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we conducted a scoping review of grooming strategies both pre- and post-Internet. Our goal was to enumerate strategies analyzed in both time periods, provide similarities and differences, and discuss how changing datasets and technology have impacted the grooming process in both online and offline environments. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of peer-reviewed journal articles from 1970 to 2020 within PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo, and ERIC. This resulted in 19,679 unique articles. Titles and abstracts were screened resulting in 266 articles which were then read in full, resulting in 93 papers which qualified based on inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Grooming strategies identified pre-Internet included: enticements, coercion, isolation, substance abuse, gradual sexualization, and secrecy. In comparison, the strategies identified post-Internet were: enticements, risk assessment, trust, sexualization, fantasy, secrecy, isolation, meeting, media progression, deception, coercion, substance use as a tool, authority, and repetition. CONCLUSIONS: While grooming strategies overlapped pre and post-Internet, the timing and scope of concepts differed. Additionally, grooming offline began to incorporate technology post-Internet which functioned to increase accessibility and isolation of the victim in a similar manner to online grooming.",10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105392,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Optimization of home care nurses in Canada: A scoping review.,"Nurses are among the largest providers of home care services thus optimisation of this workforce can positively influence client outcomes. This scoping review maps existing Canadian literature on factors influencing the optimisation of home care nurses (HCNs). Arskey and O'Malley's five stages for scoping literature reviews were followed. Populations of interest included Registered Nurses, Registered/Licensed Practical Nurses, Registered Nursing Assistants, Advanced Practice Nurses, Nurse Practitioners and Clinical Nurse Specialists. Interventions included any nurse(s), organisational and system interventions focused on optimising home care nursing. Papers were included if published between January 1, 2002 up to May 15, 2015. The review included 127 papers, including 94 studies, 16 descriptive papers, 6 position papers, 4 discussion papers, 3 policy papers, 2 literature reviews and 2 other. Optimisation factors were categorised under seven domains: Continuity of Care/Care; Staffing Mix and Staffing Levels; Professional Development; Quality Practice Environments; Intra-professional and Inter-professional and Inter-sectoral Collaboration; Enhancing Scope of Practice: and, Appropriate Use of Technology. Fragmentation and underfunding of the home care sector and resultant service cuts negatively impact optimisation. Given the fiscal climate, optimising the existing workforce is essential to support effective and efficient care delivery models. Many factors are inter-related and have synergistic impacts (e.g., recruitment and retention, compensation and benefits, professional development supports, staffing mix and levels, workload management and the use of technology). Quality practice environments facilitate optimal practice by maximixing human resources and supporting workforce stability. Role clarity and leadership supports foster more effective interprofessional team functioning that leverages expertise and enhances patient outcomes. Results inform employers, policy makers and relevant associations regarding barriers and enablers that influence the optimisation of home care nursing in nursing, intra- and inter-professional and inter-organisational contexts.",10.1111/hsc.12797,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Recommendations to conduct and report systematic reviews in medical literature: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: This scoping review aims to identify, review and characterize the published recommendations to conduct and/or to report a systematic review in medical interventions area. METHODS: A search was carried out in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases, using systematic reviews search filters. The search comprises all recommendations to conduct and/or report a systematic review. Data on methods were extracted from each recommendation. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: Eighty-three recommendations were identified. Approximately 60% of retrieved references were published in the last 6â€‰years. Recommendations to both conduct and report a systematic review were issued in 47% studies. The guidance presented in each recommendation to conduct and/ or report a systematic review varied. Almost 96% of the recommendations offer guidance on systematic review methods section. The need and time for updating was only recommended in 29% of recommendations. Forty percent of recommendations endorsed their methods to any subject related to medical interventions. Half of the studies did not specify the design of studies to be included in a systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: Several recommendations to conduct and/or report a systematic review were published and offered different guidance. Further research on the impact of such heterogeneity can improve systematic reviews quality.",10.1186/s12874-019-0870-1,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,
Scientific Data Citation: Scoping Review,"Objective: This paper investigates the meaning assigned to data citation in order to follow the evolution of studies related to data citation, it tries to answer: 1) What are the motivations of researchers to cite scientific data?; 2) What are the data citation practices presented by the areas covered by this study?; 3) What are the metric analysis for data citation? Methods: It is a qualitative and descriptive research, being a scoping review of literature, by searching the Emerald, LISA, LIST, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Results: The studies investigated the correlation of citations increment to traditional publications by citing the data that supported them, many studies confirmed the correlation, others did not, and a common cause hypothesis arose: research quality associated with more resources. As for practices, the community is aware that current citations to data are not standardized, and there is a tendency to adopt a citation standard that meets the demands of different types of data. This lack of standard hinders the metric analysis of citation to scientific data that still needs to be explored in research, given that there is a repetition in using the same techniques of traditional citation for this new source of information. Conclusions: Promoting the progress of science is the main advantage in making data available, but there are credit and technical difficulties that need to be tackled together by researchers, institutions, funding agencies, data repositories, and publishing editorial teams.",10.5007/1518-2924.2020.e72153,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Grit in sport: a scoping review,"Understanding the personality characteristics that help and/or hinder competitive success in sport is of great interest to many sport psychology researchers. Grit (i.e. passion and perseverance towards long-term goals) is one such construct that has recently gained popularity in the sport domain. This scoping review explored the associations between grit and the cognitive, affective, and behavioural variables that reside within athletes and sport settings. Ninety publications were identified through various search strategies. The majority of studies explored relationships between grit and athlete sex, athlete skill/competitive level, sport performance, motivation, mindfulness, self-compassion, and deliberate practice. Constructs that have been previously critiqued as sharing significant variance with grit were also collated from the existing research. Six collegiate-level coaches were consulted as knowledgeable stakeholders and provided input to the results of the scoping review. These results allowed for the identification of future research considerations, including ameliorating current issues regarding grit measurement in sport contexts, and the designing and testing of interventions aimed at increasing athlete grit levels. Additional research with stronger methodological design and rigour is needed, and recommendations to enhance the quality of future studies with athletes are discussed.",10.1080/1750984X.2021.1934887,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
A Scoping Review of Flow Research,"Flow is a gratifying state of deep involvement and absorption that individuals report when facing a challenging activity and they perceive adequate abilities to cope with it (EFRN, 2014). The flow concept was introduced by Csikszentmihalyi in 1975, and interest in flow research is growing. However, to our best knowledge, no scoping review exists that takes a systematic look at studies on flow which were published between the years 2000 and 2016. Overall, 252 studies have been included in this review. Our review (1) provides a framework to cluster flow research, (2) gives a systematic overview about existing studies and their findings, and (3) provides an overview about implications for future research. The provided framework consists of three levels of flow research. In the first ""Individual "" level are the categories for personality, motivation, physiology, emotion, cognition, and behavior. The second ""Contextual "" level contains the categories for contextual and interindividual factors and the third ""Cultural "" level contains cultural factors that relate to flow. Using our framework, we systematically present the findings for each category. While flow research has made progress in understanding flow, in the future, more experimental and longitudinal studies are needed to gain deeper insights into the causal structure of flow and its antecedents and consequences.",10.3389/fpsyg.2022.815665,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Office concepts: A scoping review,"Office concepts influence employees' work experience and performance, as well as the profitability of organisations. This study used a scoping review approach to map the field of empirical research on office concepts, identify research gaps, provide recommendations for future research, and inform practice. Systematic searches across three databases identified a total of 257 empirical studies on office concepts. Study selection and data charting were performed independently by two reviewers using standardized forms, with disagreements resolved through discussion. General and methodological characteristics of the included studies were mapped. For studies comparing different office concepts, the degree of focus on spatial design and change processes were also mapped. The findings establish that this is a strongly interdisciplinary field, with increasing publication numbers in recent years. The included studies are heterogeneous, using a variety of study designs and outcome variables, and focus on various aspects of the office environment. Studies comparing different office concepts tend to not focus on spatial design or change processes. This lack might cause these areas to come across as less important than they are, and has implications for practical decision-making regarding workplace design. We recommend that future research efforts focus on conducting randomized controlled trials in real-world office settings. Further research gaps can be identified using the tables and figures included.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106294,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Community-based surveillance: A scoping review,"Background Involving community members in identifying and reporting health events for public health surveillance purposes, an approach commonly described as community-based surveillance (CBS), is increasingly gaining interest. We conducted a scoping review to list terms and definitions used to characterize CBS, to identify and summarize available guidance and recommendations, and to map information on past and existing in-country CBS systems. Methods We searched eight bibliographic databases and screened the worldwide web for any document mentioning an approach in which community members both collected and reported information on health events from their community for public health surveillance. Two independent reviewers performed double blind screening and data collection, any discrepancy was solved through discussion and consensus. Findings From the 134 included documents, several terms and definitions for CBS were retrieved. Guidance and recommendations for CBS were scattered through seven major guides and sixteen additional documents. Seventy-nine unique CBS systems implemented since 1958 in 42 countries were identified, mostly implemented in low and lower-middle income countries (79%). The systems appeared as fragmented (81% covering a limited geographical area and 70% solely implemented in a rural setting), vertical (67% with a single scope of interest), and of limited duration (median of 6 years for ongoing systems and 2 years for ended systems). Collection of information was mostly performed by recruited community members (80%). Interpretation While CBS has already been implemented in many countries, standardization is still required on the term and processes to be used. Further research is needed to ensure CBS integrates effectively into the overall public health surveillance system.",10.1371/journal.pone.0215278,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Altruism in Paramedicine: A Scoping Review,"While altruism has been studied in healthcare professions such as nursing and medicine, the exploration of the characteristics of altruism, as related to paramedicine and emergency care in Australia, is limited. This scoping review explores altruism in paramedicine from the perspective of the paramedic as practitioner, learner, and educator as seen through the lens of the paramedic and the patient. Also discussed is the positive impact of altruism on the patient experience of care. A scoping review was used to assess the availability of data related to altruism in paramedicine. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews was used to guide the process. Search categories were orientated around the subject (altruism) and discipline (paramedicine). A total of 27 articles are included in this scoping review. Initial searching identified 742 articles; after duplicate removal, 396 articles were screened with 346 excluded. Fifty articles were full-text reviewed and 23 excluded. The final 27 were extracted following full-text screening. None of the articles are specific to altruism in paramedicine. The data related to the practice of altruism in paramedicine are extremely limited. The preponderance of data arise from Europe and North America which, due to crewing and service differences, may impact the practice of altruism in different regions. Recent changes to the scope of paramedic practice, workload, education, and case acuity may influence behaviour regarding altruism, compassion, caring, and associated caring behaviours.

Through its mission, Special Olympics provides a setting for athletes that aims to foster performance, participation, and personal development. Coaches play a central role in achieving these outcomes. As such, this scoping review aims to answer the following question: What is known about Special Olympics' coach training and practices? Method Our scoping review was conducted according to Peters et al.'s (2020) guidelines. Keywords pertaining to Special Olympics, Program evaluation, and Coaches were searched in six databases to extract articles published between 1988 and October 1, 2021. Results In all, 16 studies were included in our scoping review. Of these studies, nine included information on coach training and 13 included information on coach practices. No randomized control trials were identified. Conclusions There is currently very little knowledge on Special Olympics coach training and practices. Moreover, there is no existing data to support the effectiveness of Special Olympics coaches formal training on coaches' practices nor on athletes' outcomes. There is an urgent need for research in this field.",10.1177/17479541221134338,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Diagnosing Overtraining Syndrome: A Scoping Review,"Context: Overtraining syndrome (OTS) is a condition characterized by a long-term performance decrement, which occurs after a persisting imbalance between training-related and nontraining-related load and recovery. Because of the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test, OTS remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Objective: To systematically review and map biomarkers and tools reported in the literature as potentially diagnostic for OTS. Data Sources: PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus were searched from database inception to February 4, 2021, and results screened for eligibility. Backward and forward citation tracking on eligible records were used to complement results of database searching. Study Selection: Studies including athletes with a likely OTS diagnosis, as defined by the European College of Sport Science and the American College of Sports Medicine, and reporting at least 1 biomarker or tool potentially diagnostic for OTS were deemed eligible. Study Design: Scoping review following the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Level of Evidence: Level 4. Data Extraction: Athletes' population, criteria used to diagnose OTS, potentially diagnostic biomarkers and tools, as well as miscellaneous study characteristics were extracted. Results: The search yielded 5561 results, of which 39 met the eligibility criteria. Three diagnostic scores, namely the EROS-CLINICAL, EROS-SIMPLIFIED, and EROS-COMPLETE scores (EROS = Endocrine and Metabolic Responses on Overtraining Syndrome study), were identified. Additionally, basal hormone, neurotransmitter and other metabolite levels, hormonal responses to stimuli, psychological questionnaires, exercise tests, heart rate variability, electroencephalography, immunological and redox parameters, muscle structure, and body composition were reported as potentially diagnostic for OTS. Conclusion: Specific hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolites, as well as psychological, electrocardiographic, electroencephalographic, and immunological patterns were identified as potentially diagnostic for OTS, reflecting its multisystemic nature. As exemplified by the EROS scores, combinations of these variables may be required to diagnose OTS. These scores must now be validated in larger samples and within female athletes.",10.1177/19417381211044739,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Global Scope of Hospital Pharmacy Practice: A Scoping Review,"The pharmacy profession has undergone tremendous changes over the past few decades. Pharmacists' roles have expanded their boundaries to encompass more patient-centered services. However, the degree to which these roles are practised may vary. This scoping review is aimed at describing the extent and range of the professional pharmacy services offered in hospital pharmacies across different countries and the barriers underlying inappropriate or incomplete implementation of these services. Studies published in the English language between 2015 and 2019 were retrieved from the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, EBSCO Discovery Service, and Web of Science. A thematic analysis across the included studies produced two main themes. ""Scope of practice"" comprised three subthemes: pharmaceutical care practice, clinical pharmacy practice, and public health services and ""Multiple levels of influence"" comprised five subthemes: individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and public policy-related factors. The hospital pharmacy services across countries ranged from traditional drug-centered pharmacy practice to a more progressive, clinically oriented practice. In some countries, there is an apparent inadequacy in the clinical pharmacy services provided compared to other clinical settings. Understanding the current pharmacy practice culture across different health care systems is an essential step towards improving the profession.",10.3390/healthcare8020143,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Diet and Psychosis: A Scoping Review,"Introduction: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) represent a cluster of severe mental illnesses. Diet has been identified as a modifiable risk factor and opportunity for intervention in many physical illnesses and more recently in mental illnesses such as unipolar depression; however, no dietary guidelines exist for patients with SSD. Objective: This review sought to systematically scope the existing literature in order to identify nutritional interventions for the prevention or treatment of mental health symptoms in SSD as well as gaps and opportunities for further research. Methods: This review followed established methodological approaches for scoping reviews including an extensive a priori search strategy and duplicate screening. Because of the large volume of results, an online program (Abstrackr) was used for screening and tagging. Data were extracted based on the dietary constituents and analyzed. Results: Of 55,330 results identified by the search, 822 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Observational evidence shows a connection between the presence of psychotic disorders and poorer quality dietary patterns, higher intake of refined carbohydrates and total fat, and lower intake or levels of fibre, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, vegetables, fruit, and certain vitamins and minerals (vitamin B-12 and B-6, folate, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium). Evidence illustrates a role of food allergy and sensitivity as well as microbiome composition and specific phytonutrients (such as L-theanine, sulforaphane, and resveratrol). Experimental studies have demonstrated benefit using healthy diet patterns and specific vitamins and minerals (vitamin B-12 and B-6, folate, and zinc) and amino acids (serine, lysine, glycine, and tryptophan). Discussion: Overall, these findings were consistent with many other bodies of knowledge about healthy dietary patterns. Many limitations exist related to the design of the individual studies and the ability to extrapolate the results of studies using dietary supplements to dietary interventions (food). Dietary recommendations are presented as well as recommendations for further research including more prospective observational studies and intervention studies that modify diet constituents or entire dietary patterns with statistical power to detect mental health outcomes.",10.1159/000493399,WOS,,,,,,,,,,, 
Norms in sport: a scoping review,"The influence of a 'group' is often posited as a key factor that influences behavior. This is relevant in sports, where the presence of norms develops through interactions with important others. As such, an athlete's perception of what is normative may have a significant role in how that athlete thinks and behaves. The present study undertakes a scoping review of research on norms in sports, specifically to describe the extent, scope and range of research conducted to date. Six online databases were searched to identify research published up to January 2021, from which 124 met inclusion criteria. To be included, articles were published peer-reviewed articles, written in English and evaluated norms within an athlete sample. The results suggest that the use of theoretical frameworks and conceptualizations of norms varied considerably and were used inconsistently. Most studies included in this review used a cross-sectional research design, were conducted within North America, and focused on adult athlete populations. This study identified that the concept of 'norms' has been examined extensively in sport, with an opportunity to explore norms in a wider range of samples and with advanced research methodologies to progress our understanding of norms in sport.",10.1080/1750984X.2022.2051151,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Fatherlessness Begins Prenatally: A Scoping Review,"Objective: Clinicians should encourage and promote paternal involvement even in prenatal care, as this early engagement has far-reaching, positive implications on a child's life. Summary: Men are not superfluous to the abortion process. In fact, a father's roles and responsibilities start before the act leading to conception and continue through the pregnancy, birth, and through their children's lives. This paper seeks to review evidence that these roles play an important part in a child's overall development. Additionally, this paper seeks to suggest direct approaches physicians may take to encourage constructive engagement and responsibility in fathers.",,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Echolalia in Autism: A Scoping Review,"Echolalia, a language phenomenon whereby individuals imitate the speech of others, is commonly used by children and adults with autism. Research into the underlying nature and meanings associated with this repetitive behaviour is characterised by a lack of conceptual definitions and conflicting opinions about the functions of echolalia. A scoping review was undertaken to summarise the range of perspectives on these topics and identify associated research gaps. Five databases were searched, and 28 studies met the eligibility criteria. Results showed clear groupings in the topics discussed, based around interactional intent, factors that affect the frequency and type of echolalia, language development, measurement, and functions of echolalia. The review revealed that echolalia has a number of functions for people with autism, however many interventions continue to focus on reduction or elimination of echolalia. Findings suggest that further research is required to examine possible functions of echolalia. Confirming the function of this behaviour for people with autism is likely to have direct consequences for the type of intervention deemed appropriate.",10.1080/1034912X.2022.2154324,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Scoping review of chronic rhinosinusitis proteomics,"Background: Progressive advances in proteomic technology has improved our understanding of the chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) pathogenesis and endotypes. This scoping review aims to present a comprehensive and descriptive analysis of nasal mucosa and mucus proteome of CRS patients. Methodology: Studies investigating the proteome of nasal mucosa and mucus from healthy and CRS patients via mass spectrometry were included. Critical appraisal of methodological quality was conducted with extraction of protein lists. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on studies including CRS patients. Results: 2962 proteins were identified in the 21 studies included in this review. Eleven studies investigated the nasal mucus proteome and ten studies investigated the nasal mucosa proteome. Studies demonstrated heterogeneity in patients, sampling and mass spectrometry methodology. Samples from CRS patients suggested a trend in enrichment of immune system and programmed cell death pathways. Increased expression of proteins involved in cellular components including the cytoskeleton and adherens junctions was also present in CRS. Conclusions: Alterations in the healthy sinonasal proteome may lead to the increased immunological, metabolic and tissue remodeling processes observed in CRS. However, it is difficult to draw significant conclusions from the GSEA due to the heterogeneity present in the limited literature available. These findings allow us to direct further research to better understand CRS pathogenesis and its endotypes.",10.4193/Rhin20.034,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
Training Cesarean Section A Scoping Review,"This study is a scoping review that reviews the existing literature on educational strategies in training of cesarean section. A systematic search was carried out in relevant databases, identifying 28 studies for inclusion. Thematic analysis revealed the following training strategies: simulation-based training (team training, in situ training, technical training), simulators (low-fidelity simulators, high-fidelity simulators), clinical training, e-learning or videos, classroom-based learning (lectures, small groups), and assessment (assessment programs/interventions, assessment of learners). Simulation-based training provides a unique milieu for training in a safe and controlled environment. Simulation-based team training is widely accepted and used in obstetrics and improves nontechnical skills, which are important in emergency cesarean section. High-fidelity simulators are advanced and realistic, but because of the expense, low-fidelity simulators may provide a reasonable method for training surgical skills. The literature in training and assessment of surgical skills in relation to cesarean section is sparse, and more studies are warranted.",10.1097/SIH.0000000000000367,WOS,,,,,,,,,,,
