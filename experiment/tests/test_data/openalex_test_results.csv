2,10.1093/humupd/dmt038,The effect of combined oral contraception on testosterone levels in healthy women: A systematic review and meta-analysis,BACKGROUNDCombined oral contraceptives (COCs) reduce levels of androgen especially testosterone (T) by inhibiting ovarian and adrenal androgen synthesis and by increasing levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Although this suppressive effect has been investigated by numerous studies over many years to our knowledge no systematic review concerning this issue had been performed. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of COCs on concentrations of total T free T and SHBG in healthy women and to evaluate differences between the various types of COCs (e.g. estrogen dose type of progestin) and the assays used to assess total T and free T.METHODSA review of the literature was performed using database searches (MEDLINE EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials) and all publications (from inception date until July 2012) investigating the effect of COCs on androgen levels in healthy women were considered eligible for selection. Three reviewers were involved in study selection data extraction and critical appraisal. For the meta-analysis data on total T free T and SHBG were extracted and combined using random effects analysis. Additional subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate differences between the various types of COCs (e.g. estrogen dose type of progestin) and the assays used to assess total T or free T.RESULTSA total of 151 records were identified by systematic review and 42 studies with a total of 1495 healthy young women (age range: 18-40 years) were included in the meta-analysis. All included studies were experimental studies and 21 were non-comparative. Pooling of the results derived from all the included papers showed that total T levels significantly decreased during COC use [mean difference (MD) (95% confidence interval CI) -0.49 nmol/l (-0.55 -0.42); P < 0.001]. Significantly lower levels of free T were also found [relative change (95% CI) 0.39 (0.35 0.43); P < 0.001] with a mean decrease of 61%. On the contrary SHBG concentrations significantly increased during all types of COC use [MD (95% CI) 99.08 nmol/l (86.43 111.73); P < 0.001]. Subgroup analyses revealed that COCs containing 20-25 microg EE had similar effects on total and free T compared with COCs with 30-35 microg EE. In addition suppressive effects on T levels were not different when comparing different types of progestins. However subgroup analyses for the estrogen dose and the progestin type in relation to changes in SHBG levels did show significant differences: COCs containing second generation progestins and/or the lower estrogen doses (20-25 microg EE) were found to have less impact on SHBG concentrations.CONCLUSIONSThe current literature review and meta-analysis demonstrates that COCs decrease circulating levels of total T and free T and increase SBHG concentrations. Due to the SHBG increase free T levels decrease twice as much as total T. The estrogen dose and progestin type of the COC do not influence the decline of total and free T but both affect SHBG. The clinical implications of suppressed androgen levels during COC use remain to be elucidated.
3,10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.09.041,Consensus on infertility treatment related to polycystic ovary syndrome,"The treatment of infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is surrounded by many controversies. On the basis of the currently available evidence, a group of experts reached a consensus regarding the therapeutic challenges raised in these women. Before any intervention is initiated, preconceptional counseling should be provided emphasizing the importance of lifestyle, especially weight reduction and exercise in overweight women, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomiphene citrate (CC). Recommended second-line intervention, should CC fail to result in pregnancy, is either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS). The use of exogenous gonadotropins is associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancy, and, therefore, intense monitoring of ovarian response is required. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery alone is usually effective in less than 50% of women, and additional ovulation induction medication is required under those circumstances. Overall, ovulation induction (representing the CC-gonadotropin paradigm) is reported to be highly effective with a cumulative singleton live-birth rate of 72%. Recommended third-line treatment is in vitro fertilization (IVF). More patient-tailored approaches should be developed for ovulation induction based on initial screening characteristics of women with PCOS. Such approaches may result in deviation from the above mentioned first-line, second-line, or third-line ovulation strategies in well-defined subsets of patients. Metformin use in PCOS should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance. Based on recent data available in the literature, the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended. Insufficient evidence is currently available to recommend the clinical use of aromatase inhibitors for routine ovulation induction. Even singleton pregnancies in PCOS are associated with increased health risk for both the mother and the fetus."
4,10.1097/gme.0b013e3181d59765,Role of androgens in women's sexual dysfunction,"Although suspected, androgen deficit in women with sexual dysfunction has never been established. Given that serum testosterone levels are of limited value, we sought to compare total androgen activity in women with and without hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Intracellular production in target tissues is the major source of testosterone in older women and can now be measured. Androgen metabolites, specifically androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G), reflect intracellular and ovarian sources of testosterone. Thus, we predicted significantly lowered levels of metabolites in women with sexual dysfunction.A detailed assessment of the sexual function of women without depression, without serious relationship discord, or receiving medications affecting sexual function included 121 women with HSDD and 124 sexually healthy community controls. Sexual function was assessed using structured interviews, validated questionnaires, and steroid analysis-mass spectrometry levels of ADT-G, testosterone, and precursor hormones.No group differences in serum levels of testosterone or ADT-G were found. Significantly lower levels of two precursor hormones, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstene-3β,17β-diol, were found in women with sexual dysfunction (P = 0.006 and P = 0.020, respectively). The variability of metabolite and precursor levels was substantial for all women.Significantly lower levels of the two precursor steroids dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstene-3β,17β-diol but not the major androgen metabolite ADT-G were found in women with HSDD. Although the significance of the former awaits further study, androgen deficiency in women with HSDD was not confirmed. Given the unknown long-term effects of testosterone supplementation, women receiving testosterone therapy should be informed that a deficit of testosterone activity in women with HSDD has not been identified."

PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility and manifests with hirsutism, acne, and obesity. To investigate its impact on health-related quality of life and sexuality, 50 women with PCOS and 50 controls were evaluated with standardized questionnaires (36-item short-form health survey, symptom checklist revised, and life satisfaction questionnaire). The impact of hirsutism, obesity, and infertility was assessed using five-point rating scales, and sexual satisfaction was analyzed with visual analog scales. Patients showed greater psychological disturbances on the symptom checklist revised dimensions, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, aggression, and psychoticism, along with a lower degree of life satisfaction in the life satisfaction questionnaire scales health, self, and sex. Health-related quality of life measured with the 36-item short-form health survey revealed significantly decreased scores for physical role function, bodily pain, vitality, social function, emotional role function, and mental health in patients with PCOS. Although patients had the same partner status and frequency of sexual intercourse, they were significantly less satisfied with their sex life and found themselves less attractive. Most of the differences were not affected by correction for body weight. In conclusion, PCOS causes a major reduction in the quality of life and severely limits sexual satisfaction."
6,10.1080/00926230590475206,The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI): Cross-Validation and Development of Clinical Cutoff Scores,"The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a brief multidimensional scale for assessing sexual function in women. The scale has received initial psychometric evaluation, including studies of reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity (Meston, 2003; Rosen et al., 2000). The present study was designed to crossvalidate the FSFI in several samples of women with mixed sexual dysfunctions (N = 568) and to develop diagnostic cut-off scores for potential classification of women's sexual dysfunction. Some of these samples were drawn from our previous validation studies (N = 414), and some were added for purposes of the present study (N = 154). The combined data set consisted of multiple samples of women with sexual dysfunction diagnoses (N = 307), including female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female sexual orgasm disorder (FSOD), dyspareunia/vaginismus (pain), and multiple sexual dysfunctions, in addition to a large sample of nondysfunctional controls (n = 261). We conducted analyses on the individual and combined samples, including replicating the original factor structure using principal components analysis with varimax rotation. We assessed Cronbach's alpha (internal reliability) and interdomain correlations and tested discriminant validity by means of a MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance; dysfunction diagnosis x FSFI domain), with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons. We developed diagnostic cut off scores by means of standard receiver operating characteristics-curves and the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) procedure. Principal components analysis replicated the original five-factor structure, including desire/arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain, and satisfaction. We found the internal reliability for the total FSFI and six domain scores to be good to excellent, with Cronbach alpha's >0.9 for the combined sample and above 0.8 for the sexually dysfunctional and nondysfunctional samples, independently. Discriminant validity testing confirmed the ability of both total and domain scores to differentiate between functional and nondysfunctional women. On the basis of sensitivity and specificity analyses and the CART procedure, we found an FSFI total score of 26.55 to be the optimal cut score for differentiating women with and without sexual dysfunction. On the basis of this cut-off we found 70.7% of women with sexual dysfunction and 88.1% of the sexually functional women in the cross-validation sample to be correctly classified. Addition of the lubrication score in the model resulted in slightly improved specificity (from .707 to .772) at a slight cost of sensitivity (from .881 to .854) for identifying women without sexual dysfunction. We discuss the results in terms of potential strengths and weaknesses of the FSFI, as well in terms of further clinical and research implications."
7,10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02334.x,Development and psychometric properties of the Female Sexual Desire Questionnaire (FSDQ),"Sexual desire is often evaluated as part of a global assessment of female sexual function, which may not comprehensively evaluate the various facets of this experience. There currently exists a need to develop a psychometrically robust desire-specific measure for women.The aim of this study was to develop and validate a desire-specific, self-administered instrument that evaluates the multiple facets of sexual desire and factors influencing this experience for partnered heterosexual women, with or without sexual dysfunction.Preliminary items for inclusion in the Female Sexual Desire Questionnaire (FSDQ) were identified through a literature review and individual interviews with partnered heterosexual women, mostly from Australia. The resulting instrument was completed by a validation sample of 741 women, aged between 18 and 71 years, who were involved in a heterosexual relationship of between 3 months' and 49 years' duration. Exploratory factor analysis was used to refine the FSDQ item content and identify the underlying domain structure. The reliability (internal consistency) and validity (convergent validity) of the FSDQ were also evaluated.The final version of the FSDQ consisted of 50 items organized into six domains that characterized the experience of, and factors influencing, sexual desire for heterosexual partnered women: Dyadic Desire, Solitary Desire, Resistance, Positive Relationship, Sexual Self-Image, and Concern. Each domain demonstrated high reliability, as did the overall measure. Evidence of construct validity was ascertained through convergence with the Sexual Desire Inventory and the Hurlbert Index of Sexual Desire. A short-form of the FSDQ, consisting of six items, was also developed.The FSDQ is a new reliable and valid multidimensional measure designed specifically for evaluating the facets of, and factors influencing, sexual desire among sexually functional and dysfunctional women who are involved in a heterosexual relationship."

The scale was designed for use in repeated administrations at periodic intervals in order that therapists might continually monitor and evaluate their clients' response to treatment. Internal consistency and test‐retest reliability were found to be in excess of .90, and the scale has a discriminant validity coefficient of .76."

No section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents, and minority opinions noted. Statements were not included that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence. <h3>Conclusion(s)</h3> Based on the available data, it is the view of the AE-PCOS Society Task Force that PCOS should be defined by the presence of hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical), ovarian dysfunction (oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries), and the exclusion of related disorders. However, a minority considered the possibility that there may be forms of PCOS without overt evidence of hyperandrogenism, but recognized that more data are required before validating this supposition. Finally, the Task Force recognized and fully expects that the definition of this syndrome will evolve over time to incorporate new research findings."
12,10.1093/humrep/deh098,A.-S.P.c.w.g. Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).,"Since the 1990 NIH-sponsored conference on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it has become appreciated that the syndrome encompasses a broader spectrum of signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction than those defined by the original diagnostic criteria. The 2003 Rotterdam consensus workshop concluded that PCOS is a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction along with the cardinal features hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology. PCOS remains a syndrome and, as such, no single diagnostic criterion (such as hyperandrogenism or PCO) is sufficient for clinical diagnosis. Its clinical manifestations may include: menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess, and obesity. Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common features in PCOS. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events."
13,10.1530/eje.1.02024,Clinical and psychological correlates of quality-of-life in polycystic ovary syndrome,"Objective : Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been shown to cause a reduction in quality of life. This study examines the extent of different PCOS symptoms on quality-of-life, psychosocial well-being and sexual satisfaction. Methods : Complete metabolic, hormonal, clinical and psychosocial data were obtained from a total of 120 women with PCOS. Patients were compared with 50 healthy women to establish reductions in quality-of-life and emotional well-being. In addition, the correlation between psychosocial variables and the major clinical PCOS features obesity (body mass index (BMI)), excessive body hair (hirsutism score), acne, hyperandrogenism (serum testosterone levels), disturbed insulin regulation (area under the insulin response curve and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), menstrual cycle disturbances and infertility were analyzed. Results : PCOS patients showed significant reductions in quality-of-life, increased psychological disturbances, and decreased sexual satisfaction when compared with healthy controls. BMI and hirsutism scores, but not the presence of acne, were associated with physical aspects of quality-of-life and sexual satisfaction. No clear effect of androgens or insulin resistance on psychosocial variables was detected. Similarly, the type of menstrual cycle disturbances or infertility had no impact on psychological well-being. Conclusion : In PCOS, changes in appearance, particularly obesity and hirsutism, reduce physical dimensions of quality-of-life and decrease sexual satisfaction. The role of biochemical, endocrine and metabolic parameters as well as menstrual irregularities and infertility appeared to be less important. Clinicians should pay attention to the psychosocial dimensions of PCOS on an individual basis, regardless of symptom severity or treatment response."
14,10.1093/humrep/dei409,Determinants of emotional distress in women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"The goals were to analyse the incidence of mental distress in women with untreated polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) using self-report measures, to characterize PCOS patients at risk for psychiatric disease with regard to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and to assess the impact of emotional distress on quality of life.Complete metabolic, hormonal, clinical and self-report psychological data [emotional distress, Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90-R); quality of life, Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36); sexual satisfaction, visual analogue scales; sociodemographic data] were obtained from n = 143 untreated women with PCOS. Prior psychiatric diagnoses were exclusionary. Twenty-two patients (15.4%) had a possible psychological disorder, based on SCL-90-R global severity index (GSI) scores > or =63 (SCL cases). SCL cases had significantly elevated body mass index (BMI), but did not differ from SCL non-cases in other clinical, endocrine, metabolic or sociodemographic variables. Stepwise multiple regression analyses identified GSI as a significant predictor of SF-36 Psychological Sum score, along with age and current wish to conceive (R2 = 0.47); the SF-36 Physical Sum score was predicted by BMI and education (R2 = 0.27), but not GSI.Psychiatric illness may go undetected in a proportion of PCOS patients. Although the majority of patients exhibit subclinical levels of psychological disturbances, emotional distress together with obesity lead to large decrements in quality of life in PCOS."
15,10.1093/humupd/dms029, Emotional distress is a common risk in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 studies,"BACKGROUND For a number of reasons, the results of previous meta-analyses may not fully reflect the mental health status of the average woman suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or the causes of this distress. Our objective was to examine emotional distress and its associated features in women with PCOS. METHODS A comprehensive meta-analysis of comparative studies reporting measures of depression, anxiety or emotional-subscales of quality of life (emoQoL) was performed. PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo and the Cochrane trial register databases were searched up to November 2011 (see Supplementary Data for PUBMED search string). Unpublished data obtained through contact with authors were also included. The standardized mean difference (SMD) of distress scores was calculated. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis of methodological and PCOS-related features were performed. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies (2384 patients and 2705 control women) were included. Higher emotional distress was consistently found for women with PCOS compared with control populations [main outcomes: depression: 26 studies, SMD 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.73), anxiety: 17 studies, SMD of 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.63), emoQoL: 8 studies, SMD -0.66 (95% CI -0.92 to -0.41)]. However, heterogeneity was present (I(2) 52-76%). Methodological and clinical aspects only partly explained effect size variation. CONCLUSIONS Women with PCOS exhibit significantly more emotional distress compared with women without PCOS. However, distress scores mostly remain within the normal range. The cause of emotional distress could only partly be explained by methodological or clinical features. Clinicians should be aware of the emotional aspects of PCOS, discuss these with patients and refer for appropriate support where necessary and in accordance with patient preference."

Most of the differences were not affected by correction for body weight. In conclusion, PCOS causes a major reduction in the quality of life and severely limits sexual satisfaction."

The scale has received initial psychometric evaluation, including studies of reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity (Meston, 2003; Rosen et al., 2000). The present study was designed to crossvalidate the FSFI in several samples of women with mixed sexual dysfunctions (N = 568) and to develop diagnostic cut-off scores for potential classification of women's sexual dysfunction. Some of these samples were drawn from our previous validation studies (N = 414), and some were added for purposes of the present study (N = 154). The combined data set consisted of multiple samples of women with sexual dysfunction diagnoses (N = 307), including female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female sexual orgasm disorder (FSOD), dyspareunia/vaginismus (pain), and multiple sexual dysfunctions, in addition to a large sample of nondysfunctional controls (n = 261). We conducted analyses on the individual and combined samples, including replicating the original factor structure using principal components analysis with varimax rotation. We assessed Cronbach's alpha (internal reliability) and interdomain correlations and tested discriminant validity by means of a MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance; dysfunction diagnosis x FSFI domain), with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons. We developed diagnostic cut off scores by means of standard receiver operating characteristics-curves and the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) procedure. Principal components analysis replicated the original five-factor structure, including desire/arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain, and satisfaction. We found the internal reliability for the total FSFI and six domain scores to be good to excellent, with Cronbach alpha's >0.9 for the combined sample and above 0.8 for the sexually dysfunctional and nondysfunctional samples, independently. Discriminant validity testing confirmed the ability of both total and domain scores to differentiate between functional and nondysfunctional women. On the basis of sensitivity and specificity analyses and the CART procedure, we found an FSFI total score of 26.55 to be the optimal cut score for differentiating women with and without sexual dysfunction. On the basis of this cut-off we found 70.7% of women with sexual dysfunction and 88.1% of the sexually functional women in the cross-validation sample to be correctly classified. Addition of the lubrication score in the model resulted in slightly improved specificity (from .707 to .772) at a slight cost of sensitivity (from .881 to .854) for identifying women without sexual dysfunction. We discuss the results in terms of potential strengths and weaknesses of the FSFI, as well in terms of further clinical and research implications."

Exploratory factor analysis was used to refine the FSDQ item content and identify the underlying domain structure. The reliability (internal consistency) and validity (convergent validity) of the FSDQ were also evaluated.The final version of the FSDQ consisted of 50 items organized into six domains that characterized the experience of, and factors influencing, sexual desire for heterosexual partnered women: Dyadic Desire, Solitary Desire, Resistance, Positive Relationship, Sexual Self-Image, and Concern. Each domain demonstrated high reliability, as did the overall measure. Evidence of construct validity was ascertained through convergence with the Sexual Desire Inventory and the Hurlbert Index of Sexual Desire.

Consensus on infertility treatment related to polycystic ovary syndrome.,"The treatment of infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is surrounded by many controversies. This paper describes, on the basis of the currently available evidence, the consensus reached by a group of experts regarding the therapeutic challenges raised in these women. Before any intervention is initiated, preconceptional counselling should be provided emphasizing the importance of life style, especially weight reduction and exercise in overweight women, smoking and alcohol consumption. The recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomiphene citrate (CC). Recommended second-line intervention, should CC fail to result in pregnancy, is either exogenous gonadotrophins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS). The use of exogenous gonadotrophins is associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancy and, therefore, intense monitoring of ovarian response is required. LOS alone is usually effective in <50% of women and additional ovulation induction medication is required under those circumstances. Overall, ovulation induction (representing the CC, gonadotrophin paradigm) is reported to be highly effective with a cumulative singleton live birth rate of 72%. Recommended third-line treatment is in vitro fertilization. More patient-tailored approaches should be developed for ovulation induction based on initial screening characteristics of women with PCOS. Such approaches may result in deviation from the above mentioned first-, second- or third-line ovulation strategies in well-defined subsets of patients. Metformin use in PCOS should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance. Based on recent data available in the literature, the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended. Insufficient evidence is currently available to recommend the clinical use of aromatase inhibitors for routine ovulation induction. Even singleton pregnancies in PCOS are associated with increased health risk for both the mother and the fetus."

Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).,"Since the 1990 NIH-sponsored conference on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it has become appreciated that the syndrome encompasses a broader spectrum of signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction than those defined by the original diagnostic criteria. The 2003 Rotterdam consensus workshop concluded that PCOS is a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction along with the cardinal features hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology. PCOS remains a syndrome and, as such, no single diagnostic criterion (such as hyperandrogenism or PCO) is sufficient for clinical diagnosis. Its clinical manifestations may include: menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess, and obesity. Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common features in PCOS. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events."
29,10.1530/eje.1.02024,Clinical and psychological correlates of quality-of-life in polycystic ovary syndrome,"Objective : Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been shown to cause a reduction in quality of life. This study examines the extent of different PCOS symptoms on quality-of-life, psychosocial well-being and sexual satisfaction. Methods : Complete metabolic, hormonal, clinical and psychosocial data were obtained from a total of 120 women with PCOS. Patients were compared with 50 healthy women to establish reductions in quality-of-life and emotional well-being. In addition, the correlation between psychosocial variables and the major clinical PCOS features obesity (body mass index (BMI)), excessive body hair (hirsutism score), acne, hyperandrogenism (serum testosterone levels), disturbed insulin regulation (area under the insulin response curve and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), menstrual cycle disturbances and infertility were analyzed. Results : PCOS patients showed significant reductions in quality-of-life, increased psychological disturbances, and decreased sexual satisfaction when compared with healthy controls. BMI and hirsutism scores, but not the presence of acne, were associated with physical aspects of quality-of-life and sexual satisfaction. No clear effect of androgens or insulin resistance on psychosocial variables was detected. Similarly, the type of menstrual cycle disturbances or infertility had no impact on psychological well-being. Conclusion : In PCOS, changes in appearance, particularly obesity and hirsutism, reduce physical dimensions of quality-of-life and decrease sexual satisfaction. The role of biochemical, endocrine and metabolic parameters as well as menstrual irregularities and infertility appeared to be less important. Clinicians should pay attention to the psychosocial dimensions of PCOS on an individual basis, regardless of symptom severity or treatment response."

Prior psychiatric diagnoses were exclusionary. Twenty-two patients (15.4%) had a possible psychological disorder, based on SCL-90-R global severity index (GSI) scores > or =63 (SCL cases). SCL cases had significantly elevated body mass index (BMI), but did not differ from SCL non-cases in other clinical, endocrine, metabolic or sociodemographic variables. Stepwise multiple regression analyses identified GSI as a significant predictor of SF-36 Psychological Sum score, along with age and current wish to conceive (R2 = 0.47); the SF-36 Physical Sum score was predicted by BMI and education (R2 = 0.27), but not GSI.Psychiatric illness may go undetected in a proportion of PCOS patients. Although the majority of patients exhibit subclinical levels of psychological disturbances, emotional distress together with obesity lead to large decrements in quality of life in PCOS."
31,10.1093/humupd/dms029, Emotional distress is a common risk in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 studies,"BACKGROUND For a number of reasons, the results of previous meta-analyses may not fully reflect the mental health status of the average woman suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or the causes of this distress. Our objective was to examine emotional distress and its associated features in women with PCOS. METHODS A comprehensive meta-analysis of comparative studies reporting measures of depression, anxiety or emotional-subscales of quality of life (emoQoL) was performed. PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo and the Cochrane trial register databases were searched up to November 2011 (see Supplementary Data for PUBMED search string). Unpublished data obtained through contact with authors were also included. The standardized mean difference (SMD) of distress scores was calculated. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis of methodological and PCOS-related features were performed. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies (2384 patients and 2705 control women) were included. Higher emotional distress was consistently found for women with PCOS compared with control populations [main outcomes: depression: 26 studies, SMD 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.73), anxiety: 17 studies, SMD of 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.63), emoQoL: 8 studies, SMD -0.66 (95% CI -0.92 to -0.41)]. However, heterogeneity was present (I(2) 52-76%). Methodological and clinical aspects only partly explained effect size variation. CONCLUSIONS Women with PCOS exhibit significantly more emotional distress compared with women without PCOS. However, distress scores mostly remain within the normal range. The cause of emotional distress could only partly be explained by methodological or clinical features. Clinicians should be aware of the emotional aspects of PCOS, discuss these with patients and refer for appropriate support where necessary and in accordance with patient preference."

34,10.1093/humupd/dmt038,The effect of combined oral contraception on testosterone levels in healthy women: A systematic review and meta-analysis,BACKGROUNDCombined oral contraceptives (COCs) reduce levels of androgen especially testosterone (T) by inhibiting ovarian and adrenal androgen synthesis and by increasing levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Although this suppressive effect has been investigated by numerous studies over many years to our knowledge no systematic review concerning this issue had been performed. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of COCs on concentrations of total T free T and SHBG in healthy women and to evaluate differences between the various types of COCs (e.g. estrogen dose type of progestin) and the assays used to assess total T and free T.METHODSA review of the literature was performed using database searches (MEDLINE EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials) and all publications (from inception date until July 2012) investigating the effect of COCs on androgen levels in healthy women were considered eligible for selection. Three reviewers were involved in study selection data extraction and critical appraisal. For the meta-analysis data on total T free T and SHBG were extracted and combined using random effects analysis. Additional subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate differences between the various types of COCs (e.g. estrogen dose type of progestin) and the assays used to assess total T or free T.RESULTSA total of 151 records were identified by systematic review and 42 studies with a total of 1495 healthy young women (age range: 18-40 years) were included in the meta-analysis. All included studies were experimental studies and 21 were non-comparative. Pooling of the results derived from all the included papers showed that total T levels significantly decreased during COC use [mean difference (MD) (95% confidence interval CI) -0.49 nmol/l (-0.55 -0.42); P < 0.001]. Significantly lower levels of free T were also found [relative change (95% CI) 0.39 (0.35 0.43); P < 0.001] with a mean decrease of 61%. On the contrary SHBG concentrations significantly increased during all types of COC use [MD (95% CI) 99.08 nmol/l (86.43 111.73); P < 0.001]. Subgroup analyses revealed that COCs containing 20-25 microg EE had similar effects on total and free T compared with COCs with 30-35 microg EE. In addition suppressive effects on T levels were not different when comparing different types of progestins. However subgroup analyses for the estrogen dose and the progestin type in relation to changes in SHBG levels did show significant differences: COCs containing second generation progestins and/or the lower estrogen doses (20-25 microg EE) were found to have less impact on SHBG concentrations.CONCLUSIONSThe current literature review and meta-analysis demonstrates that COCs decrease circulating levels of total T and free T and increase SBHG concentrations. Due to the SHBG increase free T levels decrease twice as much as total T. The estrogen dose and progestin type of the COC do not influence the decline of total and free T but both affect SHBG. The clinical implications of suppressed androgen levels during COC use remain to be elucidated.

36,10.1097/gme.0b013e3181d59765,Role of androgens in women's sexual dysfunction,"Although suspected, androgen deficit in women with sexual dysfunction has never been established. Given that serum testosterone levels are of limited value, we sought to compare total androgen activity in women with and without hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Intracellular production in target tissues is the major source of testosterone in older women and can now be measured. Androgen metabolites, specifically androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G), reflect intracellular and ovarian sources of testosterone. Thus, we predicted significantly lowered levels of metabolites in women with sexual dysfunction.A detailed assessment of the sexual function of women without depression, without serious relationship discord, or receiving medications affecting sexual function included 121 women with HSDD and 124 sexually healthy community controls. Sexual function was assessed using structured interviews, validated questionnaires, and steroid analysis-mass spectrometry levels of ADT-G, testosterone, and precursor hormones.No group differences in serum levels of testosterone or ADT-G were found. Significantly lower levels of two precursor hormones, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstene-3β,17β-diol, were found in women with sexual dysfunction (P = 0.006 and P = 0.020, respectively). The variability of metabolite and precursor levels was substantial for all women.Significantly lower levels of the two precursor steroids dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstene-3β,17β-diol but not the major androgen metabolite ADT-G were found in women with HSDD. Although the significance of the former awaits further study, androgen deficiency in women with HSDD was not confirmed. Given the unknown long-term effects of testosterone supplementation, women receiving testosterone therapy should be informed that a deficit of testosterone activity in women with HSDD has not been identified."

PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility and manifests with hirsutism, acne, and obesity. To investigate its impact on health-related quality of life and sexuality, 50 women with PCOS and 50 controls were evaluated with standardized questionnaires (36-item short-form health survey, symptom checklist revised, and life satisfaction questionnaire). The impact of hirsutism, obesity, and infertility was assessed using five-point rating scales, and sexual satisfaction was analyzed with visual analog scales. Patients showed greater psychological disturbances on the symptom checklist revised dimensions, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, aggression, and psychoticism, along with a lower degree of life satisfaction in the life satisfaction questionnaire scales health, self, and sex. Health-related quality of life measured with the 36-item short-form health survey revealed significantly decreased scores for physical role function, bodily pain, vitality, social function, emotional role function, and mental health in patients with PCOS.

This study examines the extent of different PCOS symptoms on quality-of-life, psychosocial well-being and sexual satisfaction. Methods : Complete metabolic, hormonal, clinical and psychosocial data were obtained from a total of 120 women with PCOS. Patients were compared with 50 healthy women to establish reductions in quality-of-life and emotional well-being. In addition, the correlation between psychosocial variables and the major clinical PCOS features obesity (body mass index (BMI)), excessive body hair (hirsutism score), acne, hyperandrogenism (serum testosterone levels), disturbed insulin regulation (area under the insulin response curve and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), menstrual cycle disturbances and infertility were analyzed. Results : PCOS patients showed significant reductions in quality-of-life, increased psychological disturbances, and decreased sexual satisfaction when compared with healthy controls. BMI and hirsutism scores, but not the presence of acne, were associated with physical aspects of quality-of-life and sexual satisfaction. No clear effect of androgens or insulin resistance on psychosocial variables was detected. Similarly, the type of menstrual cycle disturbances or infertility had no impact on psychological well-being. Conclusion : In PCOS, changes in appearance, particularly obesity and hirsutism, reduce physical dimensions of quality-of-life and decrease sexual satisfaction. The role of biochemical, endocrine and metabolic parameters as well as menstrual irregularities and infertility appeared to be less important. Clinicians should pay attention to the psychosocial dimensions of PCOS on an individual basis, regardless of symptom severity or treatment response."

Our objective was to examine emotional distress and its associated features in women with PCOS. METHODS A comprehensive meta-analysis of comparative studies reporting measures of depression, anxiety or emotional-subscales of quality of life (emoQoL) was performed. PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo and the Cochrane trial register databases were searched up to November 2011 (see Supplementary Data for PUBMED search string). Unpublished data obtained through contact with authors were also included. The standardized mean difference (SMD) of distress scores was calculated. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis of methodological and PCOS-related features were performed. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies (2384 patients and 2705 control women) were included. Higher emotional distress was consistently found for women with PCOS compared with control populations [main outcomes: depression: 26 studies, SMD 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.73), anxiety: 17 studies, SMD of 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.63), emoQoL: 8 studies, SMD -0.66 (95% CI -0.92 to -0.41)]. However, heterogeneity was present (I(2) 52-76%). Methodological and clinical aspects only partly explained effect size variation. CONCLUSIONS Women with PCOS exhibit significantly more emotional distress compared with women without PCOS. However, distress scores mostly remain within the normal range. The cause of emotional distress could only partly be explained by methodological or clinical features.

50,10.1093/humupd/dmt038,The effect of combined oral contraception on testosterone levels in healthy women: A systematic review and meta-analysis,BACKGROUNDCombined oral contraceptives (COCs) reduce levels of androgen especially testosterone (T) by inhibiting ovarian and adrenal androgen synthesis and by increasing levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Although this suppressive effect has been investigated by numerous studies over many years to our knowledge no systematic review concerning this issue had been performed. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of COCs on concentrations of total T free T and SHBG in healthy women and to evaluate differences between the various types of COCs (e.g. estrogen dose type of progestin) and the assays used to assess total T and free T.METHODSA review of the literature was performed using database searches (MEDLINE EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials) and all publications (from inception date until July 2012) investigating the effect of COCs on androgen levels in healthy women were considered eligible for selection. Three reviewers were involved in study selection data extraction and critical appraisal. For the meta-analysis data on total T free T and SHBG were extracted and combined using random effects analysis. Additional subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate differences between the various types of COCs (e.g. estrogen dose type of progestin) and the assays used to assess total T or free T.RESULTSA total of 151 records were identified by systematic review and 42 studies with a total of 1495 healthy young women (age range: 18-40 years) were included in the meta-analysis. All included studies were experimental studies and 21 were non-comparative. Pooling of the results derived from all the included papers showed that total T levels significantly decreased during COC use [mean difference (MD) (95% confidence interval CI) -0.49 nmol/l (-0.55 -0.42); P < 0.001]. Significantly lower levels of free T were also found [relative change (95% CI) 0.39 (0.35 0.43); P < 0.001] with a mean decrease of 61%. On the contrary SHBG concentrations significantly increased during all types of COC use [MD (95% CI) 99.08 nmol/l (86.43 111.73); P < 0.001]. Subgroup analyses revealed that COCs containing 20-25 microg EE had similar effects on total and free T compared with COCs with 30-35 microg EE. In addition suppressive effects on T levels were not different when comparing different types of progestins. However subgroup analyses for the estrogen dose and the progestin type in relation to changes in SHBG levels did show significant differences: COCs containing second generation progestins and/or the lower estrogen doses (20-25 microg EE) were found to have less impact on SHBG concentrations.CONCLUSIONSThe current literature review and meta-analysis demonstrates that COCs decrease circulating levels of total T and free T and increase SBHG concentrations. Due to the SHBG increase free T levels decrease twice as much as total T. The estrogen dose and progestin type of the COC do not influence the decline of total and free T but both affect SHBG. The clinical implications of suppressed androgen levels during COC use remain to be elucidated.
51,10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.09.041,Consensus on infertility treatment related to polycystic ovary syndrome,"The treatment of infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is surrounded by many controversies. On the basis of the currently available evidence, a group of experts reached a consensus regarding the therapeutic challenges raised in these women. Before any intervention is initiated, preconceptional counseling should be provided emphasizing the importance of lifestyle, especially weight reduction and exercise in overweight women, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomiphene citrate (CC). Recommended second-line intervention, should CC fail to result in pregnancy, is either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS). The use of exogenous gonadotropins is associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancy, and, therefore, intense monitoring of ovarian response is required. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery alone is usually effective in less than 50% of women, and additional ovulation induction medication is required under those circumstances. Overall, ovulation induction (representing the CC-gonadotropin paradigm) is reported to be highly effective with a cumulative singleton live-birth rate of 72%. Recommended third-line treatment is in vitro fertilization (IVF). More patient-tailored approaches should be developed for ovulation induction based on initial screening characteristics of women with PCOS. Such approaches may result in deviation from the above mentioned first-line, second-line, or third-line ovulation strategies in well-defined subsets of patients. Metformin use in PCOS should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance. Based on recent data available in the literature, the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended. Insufficient evidence is currently available to recommend the clinical use of aromatase inhibitors for routine ovulation induction. Even singleton pregnancies in PCOS are associated with increased health risk for both the mother and the fetus."
52,10.1097/gme.0b013e3181d59765,Role of androgens in women's sexual dysfunction,"Although suspected, androgen deficit in women with sexual dysfunction has never been established. Given that serum testosterone levels are of limited value, we sought to compare total androgen activity in women with and without hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Intracellular production in target tissues is the major source of testosterone in older women and can now be measured. Androgen metabolites, specifically androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G), reflect intracellular and ovarian sources of testosterone. Thus, we predicted significantly lowered levels of metabolites in women with sexual dysfunction.A detailed assessment of the sexual function of women without depression, without serious relationship discord, or receiving medications affecting sexual function included 121 women with HSDD and 124 sexually healthy community controls. Sexual function was assessed using structured interviews, validated questionnaires, and steroid analysis-mass spectrometry levels of ADT-G, testosterone, and precursor hormones.No group differences in serum levels of testosterone or ADT-G were found. Significantly lower levels of two precursor hormones, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstene-3β,17β-diol, were found in women with sexual dysfunction (P = 0.006 and P = 0.020, respectively). The variability of metabolite and precursor levels was substantial for all women.Significantly lower levels of the two precursor steroids dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstene-3β,17β-diol but not the major androgen metabolite ADT-G were found in women with HSDD. Although the significance of the former awaits further study, androgen deficiency in women with HSDD was not confirmed. Given the unknown long-term effects of testosterone supplementation, women receiving testosterone therapy should be informed that a deficit of testosterone activity in women with HSDD has not been identified."
53,10.1210/jc.2003-030562,"Quality of Life, Psychosocial Well-Being, and Sexual Satisfaction in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism. PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility and manifests with hirsutism, acne, and obesity. To investigate its impact on health-related quality of life and sexuality, 50 women with PCOS and 50 controls were evaluated with standardized questionnaires (36-item short-form health survey, symptom checklist revised, and life satisfaction questionnaire). The impact of hirsutism, obesity, and infertility was assessed using five-point rating scales, and sexual satisfaction was analyzed with visual analog scales. Patients showed greater psychological disturbances on the symptom checklist revised dimensions, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, aggression, and psychoticism, along with a lower degree of life satisfaction in the life satisfaction questionnaire scales health, self, and sex. Health-related quality of life measured with the 36-item short-form health survey revealed significantly decreased scores for physical role function, bodily pain, vitality, social function, emotional role function, and mental health in patients with PCOS. Although patients had the same partner status and frequency of sexual intercourse, they were significantly less satisfied with their sex life and found themselves less attractive. Most of the differences were not affected by correction for body weight. In conclusion, PCOS causes a major reduction in the quality of life and severely limits sexual satisfaction."
54,10.1080/00926230590475206,The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI): Cross-Validation and Development of Clinical Cutoff Scores,"The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a brief multidimensional scale for assessing sexual function in women. The scale has received initial psychometric evaluation, including studies of reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity (Meston, 2003; Rosen et al., 2000). The present study was designed to crossvalidate the FSFI in several samples of women with mixed sexual dysfunctions (N = 568) and to develop diagnostic cut-off scores for potential classification of women's sexual dysfunction. Some of these samples were drawn from our previous validation studies (N = 414), and some were added for purposes of the present study (N = 154). The combined data set consisted of multiple samples of women with sexual dysfunction diagnoses (N = 307), including female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female sexual orgasm disorder (FSOD), dyspareunia/vaginismus (pain), and multiple sexual dysfunctions, in addition to a large sample of nondysfunctional controls (n = 261). We conducted analyses on the individual and combined samples, including replicating the original factor structure using principal components analysis with varimax rotation. We assessed Cronbach's alpha (internal reliability) and interdomain correlations and tested discriminant validity by means of a MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance; dysfunction diagnosis x FSFI domain), with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons. We developed diagnostic cut off scores by means of standard receiver operating characteristics-curves and the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) procedure. Principal components analysis replicated the original five-factor structure, including desire/arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain, and satisfaction. We found the internal reliability for the total FSFI and six domain scores to be good to excellent, with Cronbach alpha's >0.9 for the combined sample and above 0.8 for the sexually dysfunctional and nondysfunctional samples, independently. Discriminant validity testing confirmed the ability of both total and domain scores to differentiate between functional and nondysfunctional women. On the basis of sensitivity and specificity analyses and the CART procedure, we found an FSFI total score of 26.55 to be the optimal cut score for differentiating women with and without sexual dysfunction. On the basis of this cut-off we found 70.7% of women with sexual dysfunction and 88.1% of the sexually functional women in the cross-validation sample to be correctly classified. Addition of the lubrication score in the model resulted in slightly improved specificity (from .707 to .772) at a slight cost of sensitivity (from .881 to .854) for identifying women without sexual dysfunction. We discuss the results in terms of potential strengths and weaknesses of the FSFI, as well in terms of further clinical and research implications."
55,10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02334.x,Development and psychometric properties of the Female Sexual Desire Questionnaire (FSDQ),"Sexual desire is often evaluated as part of a global assessment of female sexual function, which may not comprehensively evaluate the various facets of this experience. There currently exists a need to develop a psychometrically robust desire-specific measure for women.The aim of this study was to develop and validate a desire-specific, self-administered instrument that evaluates the multiple facets of sexual desire and factors influencing this experience for partnered heterosexual women, with or without sexual dysfunction.Preliminary items for inclusion in the Female Sexual Desire Questionnaire (FSDQ) were identified through a literature review and individual interviews with partnered heterosexual women, mostly from Australia. The resulting instrument was completed by a validation sample of 741 women, aged between 18 and 71 years, who were involved in a heterosexual relationship of between 3 months' and 49 years' duration. Exploratory factor analysis was used to refine the FSDQ item content and identify the underlying domain structure. The reliability (internal consistency) and validity (convergent validity) of the FSDQ were also evaluated.The final version of the FSDQ consisted of 50 items organized into six domains that characterized the experience of, and factors influencing, sexual desire for heterosexual partnered women: Dyadic Desire, Solitary Desire, Resistance, Positive Relationship, Sexual Self-Image, and Concern. Each domain demonstrated high reliability, as did the overall measure. Evidence of construct validity was ascertained through convergence with the Sexual Desire Inventory and the Hurlbert Index of Sexual Desire. A short-form of the FSDQ, consisting of six items, was also developed.The FSDQ is a new reliable and valid multidimensional measure designed specifically for evaluating the facets of, and factors influencing, sexual desire among sexually functional and dysfunctional women who are involved in a heterosexual relationship."

Internal consistency and test‐retest reliability were found to be in excess of .90, and the scale has a discriminant validity coefficient of .76."

Significantly lower levels of free T were also found [relative change (95% CI) 0.39 (0.35 0.43); P < 0.001] with a mean decrease of 61%. On the contrary SHBG concentrations significantly increased during all types of COC use [MD (95% CI) 99.08 nmol/l (86.43 111.73); P < 0.001]. Subgroup analyses revealed that COCs containing 20-25 microg EE had similar effects on total and free T compared with COCs with 30-35 microg EE. In addition suppressive effects on T levels were not different when comparing different types of progestins. However subgroup analyses for the estrogen dose and the progestin type in relation to changes in SHBG levels did show significant differences: COCs containing second generation progestins and/or the lower estrogen doses (20-25 microg EE) were found to have less impact on SHBG concentrations.CONCLUSIONSThe current literature review and meta-analysis demonstrates that COCs decrease circulating levels of total T and free T and increase SBHG concentrations. Due to the SHBG increase free T levels decrease twice as much as total T. The estrogen dose and progestin type of the COC do not influence the decline of total and free T but both affect SHBG. The clinical implications of suppressed androgen levels during COC use remain to be elucidated.

Given that serum testosterone levels are of limited value, we sought to compare total androgen activity in women with and without hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Intracellular production in target tissues is the major source of testosterone in older women and can now be measured. Androgen metabolites, specifically androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G), reflect intracellular and ovarian sources of testosterone. Thus, we predicted significantly lowered levels of metabolites in women with sexual dysfunction.A detailed assessment of the sexual function of women without depression, without serious relationship discord, or receiving medications affecting sexual function included 121 women with HSDD and 124 sexually healthy community controls. Sexual function was assessed using structured interviews, validated questionnaires, and steroid analysis-mass spectrometry levels of ADT-G, testosterone, and precursor hormones.No group differences in serum levels of testosterone or ADT-G were found. Significantly lower levels of two precursor hormones, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstene-3β,17β-diol, were found in women with sexual dysfunction (P = 0.006 and P = 0.020, respectively). The variability of metabolite and precursor levels was substantial for all women.Significantly lower levels of the two precursor steroids dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstene-3β,17β-diol but not the major androgen metabolite ADT-G were found in women with HSDD. Although the significance of the former awaits further study, androgen deficiency in women with HSDD was not confirmed.

The scale has received initial psychometric evaluation, including studies of reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity (Meston, 2003; Rosen et al., 2000). The present study was designed to crossvalidate the FSFI in several samples of women with mixed sexual dysfunctions (N = 568) and to develop diagnostic cut-off scores for potential classification of women's sexual dysfunction. Some of these samples were drawn from our previous validation studies (N = 414), and some were added for purposes of the present study (N = 154). The combined data set consisted of multiple samples of women with sexual dysfunction diagnoses (N = 307), including female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female sexual orgasm disorder (FSOD), dyspareunia/vaginismus (pain), and multiple sexual dysfunctions, in addition to a large sample of nondysfunctional controls (n = 261). We conducted analyses on the individual and combined samples, including replicating the original factor structure using principal components analysis with varimax rotation. We assessed Cronbach's alpha (internal reliability) and interdomain correlations and tested discriminant validity by means of a MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance; dysfunction diagnosis x FSFI domain), with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons. We developed diagnostic cut off scores by means of standard receiver operating characteristics-curves and the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) procedure. Principal components analysis replicated the original five-factor structure, including desire/arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain, and satisfaction. We found the internal reliability for the total FSFI and six domain scores to be good to excellent, with Cronbach alpha's >0.9 for the combined sample and above 0.8 for the sexually dysfunctional and nondysfunctional samples, independently.

71,10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02334.x,Development and psychometric properties of the Female Sexual Desire Questionnaire (FSDQ),"Sexual desire is often evaluated as part of a global assessment of female sexual function, which may not comprehensively evaluate the various facets of this experience. There currently exists a need to develop a psychometrically robust desire-specific measure for women.The aim of this study was to develop and validate a desire-specific, self-administered instrument that evaluates the multiple facets of sexual desire and factors influencing this experience for partnered heterosexual women, with or without sexual dysfunction.Preliminary items for inclusion in the Female Sexual Desire Questionnaire (FSDQ) were identified through a literature review and individual interviews with partnered heterosexual women, mostly from Australia. The resulting instrument was completed by a validation sample of 741 women, aged between 18 and 71 years, who were involved in a heterosexual relationship of between 3 months' and 49 years' duration. Exploratory factor analysis was used to refine the FSDQ item content and identify the underlying domain structure. The reliability (internal consistency) and validity (convergent validity) of the FSDQ were also evaluated.The final version of the FSDQ consisted of 50 items organized into six domains that characterized the experience of, and factors influencing, sexual desire for heterosexual partnered women: Dyadic Desire, Solitary Desire, Resistance, Positive Relationship, Sexual Self-Image, and Concern. Each domain demonstrated high reliability, as did the overall measure. Evidence of construct validity was ascertained through convergence with the Sexual Desire Inventory and the Hurlbert Index of Sexual Desire. A short-form of the FSDQ, consisting of six items, was also developed.The FSDQ is a new reliable and valid multidimensional measure designed specifically for evaluating the facets of, and factors influencing, sexual desire among sexually functional and dysfunctional women who are involved in a heterosexual relationship."

No section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents, and minority opinions noted. Statements were not included that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence. <h3>Conclusion(s)</h3> Based on the available data, it is the view of the AE-PCOS Society Task Force that PCOS should be defined by the presence of hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical), ovarian dysfunction (oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries), and the exclusion of related disorders. However, a minority considered the possibility that there may be forms of PCOS without overt evidence of hyperandrogenism, but recognized that more data are required before validating this supposition. Finally, the Task Force recognized and fully expects that the definition of this syndrome will evolve over time to incorporate new research findings."
76,10.1093/humrep/deh098,A.-S.P.c.w.g. Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).,"Since the 1990 NIH-sponsored conference on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it has become appreciated that the syndrome encompasses a broader spectrum of signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction than those defined by the original diagnostic criteria. The 2003 Rotterdam consensus workshop concluded that PCOS is a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction along with the cardinal features hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology. PCOS remains a syndrome and, as such, no single diagnostic criterion (such as hyperandrogenism or PCO) is sufficient for clinical diagnosis. Its clinical manifestations may include: menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess, and obesity. Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common features in PCOS. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events."
77,10.1530/eje.1.02024,Clinical and psychological correlates of quality-of-life in polycystic ovary syndrome,"Objective : Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been shown to cause a reduction in quality of life. This study examines the extent of different PCOS symptoms on quality-of-life, psychosocial well-being and sexual satisfaction. Methods : Complete metabolic, hormonal, clinical and psychosocial data were obtained from a total of 120 women with PCOS. Patients were compared with 50 healthy women to establish reductions in quality-of-life and emotional well-being. In addition, the correlation between psychosocial variables and the major clinical PCOS features obesity (body mass index (BMI)), excessive body hair (hirsutism score), acne, hyperandrogenism (serum testosterone levels), disturbed insulin regulation (area under the insulin response curve and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), menstrual cycle disturbances and infertility were analyzed. Results : PCOS patients showed significant reductions in quality-of-life, increased psychological disturbances, and decreased sexual satisfaction when compared with healthy controls. BMI and hirsutism scores, but not the presence of acne, were associated with physical aspects of quality-of-life and sexual satisfaction. No clear effect of androgens or insulin resistance on psychosocial variables was detected. Similarly, the type of menstrual cycle disturbances or infertility had no impact on psychological well-being. Conclusion : In PCOS, changes in appearance, particularly obesity and hirsutism, reduce physical dimensions of quality-of-life and decrease sexual satisfaction. The role of biochemical, endocrine and metabolic parameters as well as menstrual irregularities and infertility appeared to be less important. Clinicians should pay attention to the psychosocial dimensions of PCOS on an individual basis, regardless of symptom severity or treatment response."

Prior psychiatric diagnoses were exclusionary. Twenty-two patients (15.4%) had a possible psychological disorder, based on SCL-90-R global severity index (GSI) scores > or =63 (SCL cases). SCL cases had significantly elevated body mass index (BMI), but did not differ from SCL non-cases in other clinical, endocrine, metabolic or sociodemographic variables. Stepwise multiple regression analyses identified GSI as a significant predictor of SF-36 Psychological Sum score, along with age and current wish to conceive (R2 = 0.47); the SF-36 Physical Sum score was predicted by BMI and education (R2 = 0.27), but not GSI.Psychiatric illness may go undetected in a proportion of PCOS patients. Although the majority of patients exhibit subclinical levels of psychological disturbances, emotional distress together with obesity lead to large decrements in quality of life in PCOS."
79,10.1093/humupd/dms029, Emotional distress is a common risk in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 studies,"BACKGROUND For a number of reasons, the results of previous meta-analyses may not fully reflect the mental health status of the average woman suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or the causes of this distress. Our objective was to examine emotional distress and its associated features in women with PCOS. METHODS A comprehensive meta-analysis of comparative studies reporting measures of depression, anxiety or emotional-subscales of quality of life (emoQoL) was performed. PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo and the Cochrane trial register databases were searched up to November 2011 (see Supplementary Data for PUBMED search string). Unpublished data obtained through contact with authors were also included. The standardized mean difference (SMD) of distress scores was calculated. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis of methodological and PCOS-related features were performed. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies (2384 patients and 2705 control women) were included. Higher emotional distress was consistently found for women with PCOS compared with control populations [main outcomes: depression: 26 studies, SMD 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.73), anxiety: 17 studies, SMD of 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.63), emoQoL: 8 studies, SMD -0.66 (95% CI -0.92 to -0.41)]. However, heterogeneity was present (I(2) 52-76%). Methodological and clinical aspects only partly explained effect size variation. CONCLUSIONS Women with PCOS exhibit significantly more emotional distress compared with women without PCOS. However, distress scores mostly remain within the normal range. The cause of emotional distress could only partly be explained by methodological or clinical features. Clinicians should be aware of the emotional aspects of PCOS, discuss these with patients and refer for appropriate support where necessary and in accordance with patient preference."

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of COCs on concentrations of total T free T and SHBG in healthy women and to evaluate differences between the various types of COCs (e.g. estrogen dose type of progestin) and the assays used to assess total T and free T.METHODSA review of the literature was performed using database searches (MEDLINE EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials) and all publications (from inception date until July 2012) investigating the effect of COCs on androgen levels in healthy women were considered eligible for selection. Three reviewers were involved in study selection data extraction and critical appraisal. For the meta-analysis data on total T free T and SHBG were extracted and combined using random effects analysis.

Consensus on infertility treatment related to polycystic ovary syndrome.,"The treatment of infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is surrounded by many controversies. This paper describes, on the basis of the currently available evidence, the consensus reached by a group of experts regarding the therapeutic challenges raised in these women. Before any intervention is initiated, preconceptional counselling should be provided emphasizing the importance of life style, especially weight reduction and exercise in overweight women, smoking and alcohol consumption. The recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomiphene citrate (CC). Recommended second-line intervention, should CC fail to result in pregnancy, is either exogenous gonadotrophins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS). The use of exogenous gonadotrophins is associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancy and, therefore, intense monitoring of ovarian response is required. LOS alone is usually effective in <50% of women and additional ovulation induction medication is required under those circumstances. Overall, ovulation induction (representing the CC, gonadotrophin paradigm) is reported to be highly effective with a cumulative singleton live birth rate of 72%. Recommended third-line treatment is in vitro fertilization. More patient-tailored approaches should be developed for ovulation induction based on initial screening characteristics of women with PCOS. Such approaches may result in deviation from the above mentioned first-, second- or third-line ovulation strategies in well-defined subsets of patients. Metformin use in PCOS should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance. Based on recent data available in the literature, the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended. Insufficient evidence is currently available to recommend the clinical use of aromatase inhibitors for routine ovulation induction. Even singleton pregnancies in PCOS are associated with increased health risk for both the mother and the fetus."

Patients were compared with 50 healthy women to establish reductions in quality-of-life and emotional well-being. In addition, the correlation between psychosocial variables and the major clinical PCOS features obesity (body mass index (BMI)), excessive body hair (hirsutism score), acne, hyperandrogenism (serum testosterone levels), disturbed insulin regulation (area under the insulin response curve and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), menstrual cycle disturbances and infertility were analyzed. Results : PCOS patients showed significant reductions in quality-of-life, increased psychological disturbances, and decreased sexual satisfaction when compared with healthy controls. BMI and hirsutism scores, but not the presence of acne, were associated with physical aspects of quality-of-life and sexual satisfaction. No clear effect of androgens or insulin resistance on psychosocial variables was detected.

Prior psychiatric diagnoses were exclusionary. Twenty-two patients (15.4%) had a possible psychological disorder, based on SCL-90-R global severity index (GSI) scores > or =63 (SCL cases). SCL cases had significantly elevated body mass index (BMI), but did not differ from SCL non-cases in other clinical, endocrine, metabolic or sociodemographic variables. Stepwise multiple regression analyses identified GSI as a significant predictor of SF-36 Psychological Sum score, along with age and current wish to conceive (R2 = 0.47); the SF-36 Physical Sum score was predicted by BMI and education (R2 = 0.27), but not GSI.Psychiatric illness may go undetected in a proportion of PCOS patients. Although the majority of patients exhibit subclinical levels of psychological disturbances, emotional distress together with obesity lead to large decrements in quality of life in PCOS."

Our objective was to examine emotional distress and its associated features in women with PCOS. METHODS A comprehensive meta-analysis of comparative studies reporting measures of depression, anxiety or emotional-subscales of quality of life (emoQoL) was performed. PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo and the Cochrane trial register databases were searched up to November 2011 (see Supplementary Data for PUBMED search string). Unpublished data obtained through contact with authors were also included. The standardized mean difference (SMD) of distress scores was calculated. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis of methodological and PCOS-related features were performed. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies (2384 patients and 2705 control women) were included. Higher emotional distress was consistently found for women with PCOS compared with control populations [main outcomes: depression: 26 studies, SMD 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.73), anxiety: 17 studies, SMD of 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.63), emoQoL: 8 studies, SMD -0.66 (95% CI -0.92 to -0.41)]. However, heterogeneity was present (I(2) 52-76%). Methodological and clinical aspects only partly explained effect size variation. CONCLUSIONS Women with PCOS exhibit significantly more emotional distress compared with women without PCOS. However, distress scores mostly remain within the normal range. The cause of emotional distress could only partly be explained by methodological or clinical features. Clinicians should be aware of the emotional aspects of PCOS, discuss these with patients and refer for appropriate support where necessary and in accordance with patient preference."

98,10.1093/humupd/dmt038,The effect of combined oral contraception on testosterone levels in healthy women: A systematic review and meta-analysis,BACKGROUNDCombined oral contraceptives (COCs) reduce levels of androgen especially testosterone (T) by inhibiting ovarian and adrenal androgen synthesis and by increasing levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Although this suppressive effect has been investigated by numerous studies over many years to our knowledge no systematic review concerning this issue had been performed. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of COCs on concentrations of total T free T and SHBG in healthy women and to evaluate differences between the various types of COCs (e.g. estrogen dose type of progestin) and the assays used to assess total T and free T.METHODSA review of the literature was performed using database searches (MEDLINE EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials) and all publications (from inception date until July 2012) investigating the effect of COCs on androgen levels in healthy women were considered eligible for selection. Three reviewers were involved in study selection data extraction and critical appraisal. For the meta-analysis data on total T free T and SHBG were extracted and combined using random effects analysis. Additional subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate differences between the various types of COCs (e.g. estrogen dose type of progestin) and the assays used to assess total T or free T.RESULTSA total of 151 records were identified by systematic review and 42 studies with a total of 1495 healthy young women (age range: 18-40 years) were included in the meta-analysis. All included studies were experimental studies and 21 were non-comparative. Pooling of the results derived from all the included papers showed that total T levels significantly decreased during COC use [mean difference (MD) (95% confidence interval CI) -0.49 nmol/l (-0.55 -0.42); P < 0.001]. Significantly lower levels of free T were also found [relative change (95% CI) 0.39 (0.35 0.43); P < 0.001] with a mean decrease of 61%. On the contrary SHBG concentrations significantly increased during all types of COC use [MD (95% CI) 99.08 nmol/l (86.43 111.73); P < 0.001]. Subgroup analyses revealed that COCs containing 20-25 microg EE had similar effects on total and free T compared with COCs with 30-35 microg EE. In addition suppressive effects on T levels were not different when comparing different types of progestins. However subgroup analyses for the estrogen dose and the progestin type in relation to changes in SHBG levels did show significant differences: COCs containing second generation progestins and/or the lower estrogen doses (20-25 microg EE) were found to have less impact on SHBG concentrations.CONCLUSIONSThe current literature review and meta-analysis demonstrates that COCs decrease circulating levels of total T and free T and increase SBHG concentrations. Due to the SHBG increase free T levels decrease twice as much as total T. The estrogen dose and progestin type of the COC do not influence the decline of total and free T but both affect SHBG. The clinical implications of suppressed androgen levels during COC use remain to be elucidated.

100,10.1097/gme.0b013e3181d59765,Role of androgens in women's sexual dysfunction,"Although suspected, androgen deficit in women with sexual dysfunction has never been established. Given that serum testosterone levels are of limited value, we sought to compare total androgen activity in women with and without hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Intracellular production in target tissues is the major source of testosterone in older women and can now be measured. Androgen metabolites, specifically androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G), reflect intracellular and ovarian sources of testosterone. Thus, we predicted significantly lowered levels of metabolites in women with sexual dysfunction.A detailed assessment of the sexual function of women without depression, without serious relationship discord, or receiving medications affecting sexual function included 121 women with HSDD and 124 sexually healthy community controls. Sexual function was assessed using structured interviews, validated questionnaires, and steroid analysis-mass spectrometry levels of ADT-G, testosterone, and precursor hormones.No group differences in serum levels of testosterone or ADT-G were found. Significantly lower levels of two precursor hormones, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstene-3β,17β-diol, were found in women with sexual dysfunction (P = 0.006 and P = 0.020, respectively). The variability of metabolite and precursor levels was substantial for all women.Significantly lower levels of the two precursor steroids dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstene-3β,17β-diol but not the major androgen metabolite ADT-G were found in women with HSDD. Although the significance of the former awaits further study, androgen deficiency in women with HSDD was not confirmed. Given the unknown long-term effects of testosterone supplementation, women receiving testosterone therapy should be informed that a deficit of testosterone activity in women with HSDD has not been identified."
101,10.1210/jc.2003-030562,"Quality of Life, Psychosocial Well-Being, and Sexual Satisfaction in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism. PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility and manifests with hirsutism, acne, and obesity. To investigate its impact on health-related quality of life and sexuality, 50 women with PCOS and 50 controls were evaluated with standardized questionnaires (36-item short-form health survey, symptom checklist revised, and life satisfaction questionnaire). The impact of hirsutism, obesity, and infertility was assessed using five-point rating scales, and sexual satisfaction was analyzed with visual analog scales. Patients showed greater psychological disturbances on the symptom checklist revised dimensions, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, aggression, and psychoticism, along with a lower degree of life satisfaction in the life satisfaction questionnaire scales health, self, and sex. Health-related quality of life measured with the 36-item short-form health survey revealed significantly decreased scores for physical role function, bodily pain, vitality, social function, emotional role function, and mental health in patients with PCOS. Although patients had the same partner status and frequency of sexual intercourse, they were significantly less satisfied with their sex life and found themselves less attractive. Most of the differences were not affected by correction for body weight. In conclusion, PCOS causes a major reduction in the quality of life and severely limits sexual satisfaction."

The scale has received initial psychometric evaluation, including studies of reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity (Meston, 2003; Rosen et al., 2000). The present study was designed to crossvalidate the FSFI in several samples of women with mixed sexual dysfunctions (N = 568) and to develop diagnostic cut-off scores for potential classification of women's sexual dysfunction. Some of these samples were drawn from our previous validation studies (N = 414), and some were added for purposes of the present study (N = 154). The combined data set consisted of multiple samples of women with sexual dysfunction diagnoses (N = 307), including female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female sexual orgasm disorder (FSOD), dyspareunia/vaginismus (pain), and multiple sexual dysfunctions, in addition to a large sample of nondysfunctional controls (n = 261). We conducted analyses on the individual and combined samples, including replicating the original factor structure using principal components analysis with varimax rotation. We assessed Cronbach's alpha (internal reliability) and interdomain correlations and tested discriminant validity by means of a MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance; dysfunction diagnosis x FSFI domain), with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons. We developed diagnostic cut off scores by means of standard receiver operating characteristics-curves and the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) procedure. Principal components analysis replicated the original five-factor structure, including desire/arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain, and satisfaction. We found the internal reliability for the total FSFI and six domain scores to be good to excellent, with Cronbach alpha's >0.9 for the combined sample and above 0.8 for the sexually dysfunctional and nondysfunctional samples, independently. Discriminant validity testing confirmed the ability of both total and domain scores to differentiate between functional and nondysfunctional women. On the basis of sensitivity and specificity analyses and the CART procedure, we found an FSFI total score of 26.55 to be the optimal cut score for differentiating women with and without sexual dysfunction. On the basis of this cut-off we found 70.7% of women with sexual dysfunction and 88.1% of the sexually functional women in the cross-validation sample to be correctly classified. Addition of the lubrication score in the model resulted in slightly improved specificity (from .707 to .772) at a slight cost of sensitivity (from .881 to .854) for identifying women without sexual dysfunction. We discuss the results in terms of potential strengths and weaknesses of the FSFI, as well in terms of further clinical and research implications."

110,10.1093/humrep/dei409,Determinants of emotional distress in women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"The goals were to analyse the incidence of mental distress in women with untreated polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) using self-report measures, to characterize PCOS patients at risk for psychiatric disease with regard to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and to assess the impact of emotional distress on quality of life.Complete metabolic, hormonal, clinical and self-report psychological data [emotional distress, Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90-R); quality of life, Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36); sexual satisfaction, visual analogue scales; sociodemographic data] were obtained from n = 143 untreated women with PCOS. Prior psychiatric diagnoses were exclusionary. Twenty-two patients (15.4%) had a possible psychological disorder, based on SCL-90-R global severity index (GSI) scores > or =63 (SCL cases). SCL cases had significantly elevated body mass index (BMI), but did not differ from SCL non-cases in other clinical, endocrine, metabolic or sociodemographic variables. Stepwise multiple regression analyses identified GSI as a significant predictor of SF-36 Psychological Sum score, along with age and current wish to conceive (R2 = 0.47); the SF-36 Physical Sum score was predicted by BMI and education (R2 = 0.27), but not GSI.Psychiatric illness may go undetected in a proportion of PCOS patients. Although the majority of patients exhibit subclinical levels of psychological disturbances, emotional distress together with obesity lead to large decrements in quality of life in PCOS."
111,10.1093/humupd/dms029, Emotional distress is a common risk in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 studies,"BACKGROUND For a number of reasons, the results of previous meta-analyses may not fully reflect the mental health status of the average woman suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or the causes of this distress. Our objective was to examine emotional distress and its associated features in women with PCOS. METHODS A comprehensive meta-analysis of comparative studies reporting measures of depression, anxiety or emotional-subscales of quality of life (emoQoL) was performed. PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo and the Cochrane trial register databases were searched up to November 2011 (see Supplementary Data for PUBMED search string). Unpublished data obtained through contact with authors were also included. The standardized mean difference (SMD) of distress scores was calculated. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis of methodological and PCOS-related features were performed. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies (2384 patients and 2705 control women) were included. Higher emotional distress was consistently found for women with PCOS compared with control populations [main outcomes: depression: 26 studies, SMD 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.73), anxiety: 17 studies, SMD of 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.63), emoQoL: 8 studies, SMD -0.66 (95% CI -0.92 to -0.41)]. However, heterogeneity was present (I(2) 52-76%). Methodological and clinical aspects only partly explained effect size variation. CONCLUSIONS Women with PCOS exhibit significantly more emotional distress compared with women without PCOS. However, distress scores mostly remain within the normal range. The cause of emotional distress could only partly be explained by methodological or clinical features. Clinicians should be aware of the emotional aspects of PCOS, discuss these with patients and refer for appropriate support where necessary and in accordance with patient preference."
