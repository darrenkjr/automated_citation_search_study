Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a familial syndrome, associated with multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Thus, parents of affected women may have a higher prevalence of CVD events than the general population.


METHODS
PCOS probands (n = 410) and their participating parents (n = 180 fathers and 211 mothers) were queried for CVD events in themselves and non-participating family members. In order to include the family CVD history of all parents, agreement between the proband and parental reports of CVD events was assessed. Estimated 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was calculated using the Framingham risk calculator. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2002 database was used to generate gender, age and body mass index-relevant population parameters of CVD prevalence in the USA population.


RESULTS
Ninety-eight percent of the parents' self-reporting of CVD events agreed with the proband's report of parental heart attack history [Kappa = 0.82; 95% CI: (0.69, 0.94)] and 99% with parental stroke history [Kappa = 0.79; 95% CI: (0.62, 0.97)]. Fathers of women with PCOS had a higher prevalence of heart attack and stroke compared with the reference NHANES population (heart attack: 11.1 versus 5.3%, P < 0.0001; stroke: 3.0 versus 1.0%, P = 0.002). Fathers of women with PCOS had an elevated 10-year risk for CHD (11.5 versus 9.9% in NHANES, P = 0.03). No statistically significant increased prevalence of CVD events or 10-year risk was noted in probands or mothers.


CONCLUSIONS
Fathers, and not mothers, may be disproportionately burdened with CVD in PCOS families. The strengths of this study include the size of our cohort, the consistent phenotyping and the validation of proband's reporting of parental CVD events.",Human Reproduction,2011,19.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2116787291', 'name': 'Mary C Taylor'}, {'authorId': '19218453', 'name': 'A.

1,ea2bf65bd7adb468920502ae6525e99cc9c81ebb,Lifestyle changes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"BACKGROUND
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 4% to 18% of reproductive-aged women and is associated with reproductive, metabolic and psychological dysfunction. Obesity worsens the presentation of PCOS and weight management (weight loss, maintenance or prevention of excess weight gain) is proposed as an initial treatment strategy, best achieved through lifestyle changes incorporating diet, exercise and behavioural interventions.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effectiveness of lifestyle treatment in improving reproductive, anthropometric (weight and body composition), metabolic and quality of life factors in PCOS.


SEARCH STRATEGY
Electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED) (date of last search 7/9/2010), controlled trials register, conference abstracts, relevant journals, reference lists of relevant papers and reviews and grey literature databases, with no language restrictions applied.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials comparing lifestyle treatment (diet, exercise, behavioural or combined treatments) to minimal or no treatment in women with PCOS.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and risk of bias and extracted data.


MAIN RESULTS
Six studies were included with n=164 participants. Three studies compared physical activity to minimal dietary and behavioural advice or no advice. Three studies compared combined dietary, exercise and behavioural interventions to minimal intervention. Risk of bias varied with 4/6 having adequate sequence generation and clinician or outcome assessor blinding and 3/6 having adequate allocation concealment, complete outcome data and being free of selective reporting.  There were no studies assessing the fertility primary outcomes of pregnancy, live birth and miscarriage and no data for meta-analysis on ovulation or menstrual regularity. Lifestyle intervention provided benefits when compared to minimal treatment for secondary reproductive, anthropometric and reproductive outcomes. These included endpoint values for total testosterone (mean difference (MD) -0.27 nmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.46 to -0.09, P = 0.004), hirsutism or excess hair growth by the Ferriman-Gallwey score (MD -1.19, 95% CI -2.35 to -0.03, P = 0.04), weight (MD -3.47 kg, 95% CI -4.94 to -2.00, P < 0.00001), waist circumference (MD -1.95 cm, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.57, P = 0.006) and fasting insulin (MD -2.02 µU/mL, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.77, P = 0.002). There was no evidence of effect of lifestyle for body mass index, free androgen index, sex hormone binding globulin, glucose or cholesterol levels; and no data for quality of life, patient satisfaction or acne.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Lifestyle intervention improves body composition, hyperandrogenism (high male hormones and clinical effects) and insulin resistance in women with PCOS. There was no evidence of effect for lifestyle intervention on improving glucose tolerance or lipid profiles and no literature assessing clinical reproductive outcomes, quality of life and treatment satisfaction.",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2011,522.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '143832439', 'name': 'L.

The attendant hyperinsulinaemia is also thought to contribute to the mechanism of anovulation in PCOS. Both metabolic and reproductive abnormalities are amplified by obesity and the treatment of first choice for overweight or obese women with PCOS is modification of diet and lifestyle. Nevertheless, changes in diet and exercise are, for many subjects, not easy to sustain and there seems an obvious place for insulin sensitizing agents in management of both reproductive and metabolic disturbances. Of the available agents affecting insulin sensitivity, metformin has been the most widely used but despite an enormous literature reporting beneficial effects on reproductive, cutaneous and metabolic manifestations of PCOS, its efficacy is unproven apart from in those subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or frank diabetes. Metformin at least has an assured safety record whereas both efficacy and safety of other insulin sensitizing agents in women of reproductive age, such as thiazolidinediones and glucagon‐like peptide analogues, remains to be established.",Clinical Endocrinology,2011,43.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2377813', 'name': 'S.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of abnormal depression scores in women who meet currently recognized definitions of PCOS compared with women in a well-defined control group. DATA SOURCES: The search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE Classic plus EMBASE, PsycINFO, Current Contents-Clinical Medicine and Current Contents-Life Sciences and Web of Science. Cochrane software Review Manager 5.0.24 was used to construct forest plots comparing risk of abnormal depression scores in those in the PCOS and control groups. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Studies with well-defined criteria of women with PCOS and control groups of women without PCOS, with demographic information including age and body mass index (BMI), were included. Of 752 screened articles, 17 met the selection criteria for systematic review and 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Data were abstracted independently by three reviewers. All studies were cross-sectional and most used the Rotterdam criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS (n=10). The odds ratio (OR) for abnormal depression scores was 4.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.96–5.5, P<.01) in women with PCOS (n=522) compared with those in the control groups (n=475). A subanalysis showed that the odds for abnormal depression scores was independent of BMI (OR 4.09, 95% CI 2.62–6.41). Several validated tools were used to screen for depression; the common tool used was the Beck Depression Inventory. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest the need to screen all women with PCOS for depression using validated screening tools.

6,28ebeeda3dd465948be34b294ed3b3e7c35fe41e,Phenotype and metabolic profile of South Asian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): results of a large database from a specialist Endocrine Clinic.,"BACKGROUND
Compared with other populations, South Asians have a greater propensity to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). This is the first study to determine the distribution of phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and their relationship to the MetS among indigenous South Asians.


METHOD
An evaluation of the phenotype and metabolic characteristics of PCOS was conducted by recruiting consecutive women diagnosed by Rotterdam consensus criteria from an Endocrine clinic in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Prevalence of MetS was determined, in relation to the phenotypic subgroup of PCOS and compared with ethnically matched, BMI- and age-adjusted controls (n =231).


RESULTS
Acanthosis nigricans (AN) occurred in 64.6% of women with PCOS (n= 469). MetS occurred in 30.6% of the PCOS group compared with 6.34% of controls (P = 0.0001). Those with PCOS and MetS had significantly higher median BMI, blood pressure (BP), fasting plasma glucose, insulin and triglycerides and lower high-density lipoprotein and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), but similar testosterone concentrations compared with those with PCOS alone. Prevalence of MetS was similar in the four PCOS phenotypes, although oligomenorrhoeic women were more obese compared with the normal cycling hyperandrogenic group. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed age ≥35 years, BMI ≥25 kg/m(2) and AN as significant predictors of MetS in PCOS. Case-control comparisons showed that the presence of PCOS results in higher odds of having the MetS, a high waist circumference, elevated diastolic BP, abnormal fasting lipids and high fasting insulin and plasma testosterone concentrations.


CONCLUSIONS
Young indigenous South Asians with PCOS have greater odds of being centrally obese, with a third having the MetS that bears no relationship to the androgenic phenotype. Significant predictors for MetS within the PCOS cohort are advancing age, obesity determined by the Asian cut off (BMI >25 kg/m(2)) and AN, while family history of diabetes, hyperandrogenism and elevated SHBG have no predictive value.",Human Reproduction,2011,122.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '5959867', 'name': 'C.

7,34c93f7ffbb27dd6aa191fb04761dce14bdb6be4,Oligoovulatory and anovulatory cycles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): what's the difference?,"CONTEXT
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder. The phenotype may differ between patients who exhibit signs of recent ovulation and anovulatory PCOS patients.


OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to study differences in clinical and endocrine characteristics and response to ovulation induction (OI) treatment comparing oligoovulatory and anovulatory PCOS patients.


DESIGN AND SETTING
We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary hospital.


PATIENTS
PCOS patients (n=1750) presenting with oligo- or amenorrhea were diagnosed according to the Rotterdam 2003 consensus criteria. Arbitrarily, oligoovulatory PCOS was defined by a single random serum progesterone level of 10 nmol/liter or higher.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We evaluated the incidence of oligo- or amenorrhea, menstrual cycle length, serum androgen levels, follicle count, and OI outcome parameters.


RESULTS
Anovulatory women (n=1541 of 1750, 88.1%) were more often amenorrheic (P<0.001) and presented with a longer cycle duration (P<0.001) compared with oligoovulatory women (n=209 of 1750, 11.9%). Serum levels of testosterone (P<0.001), the free androgen index (P<0.001), and total follicle count (P<0.005) were higher in anovulatory compared with oligoovulatory patients. During clomiphene citrate OI, more oligoovulatory women gained regular menstrual cycles (P<0.05), whereas after second-line treatment with recombinant FSH, more anovulatory women became pregnant (P<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Oligoovulatory women with PCOS exhibit a milder phenotype of ovarian dysfunction and have a more favorable response to OI treatment using clomiphene citrate compared with anovulatory PCOS patients. However, during second-line treatment with recombinant FSH, anovulatory PCOS patients presented with a higher chance of pregnancy compared with oligoovulatory patients.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2010,32.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '10338623', 'name': 'J.

Metformin is widely prescribed to pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in an attempt to reduce pregnancy complications. Metformin is not approved for this indication, and evidence for this practice is lacking.


OBJECTIVES
Our objective was to test the hypothesis that metformin, from first trimester to delivery, reduces pregnancy complications in women with PCOS.


DESIGN AND SETTING
We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study at 11 secondary care centers.

There is no standardized assay of testosterone in women. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) has been proposed as the preferable assay by an Endocrine Society Position Statement.


OBJECTIVE
The aim was to compare assay results from a direct RIA with two LC/MS.


DESIGN AND SETTING
We conducted a blinded laboratory study including masked duplicate samples at three laboratories--two academic (University of Virginia, RIA; and Mayo Clinic, LC/MS) and one commercial (Quest, LC/MS).


PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS
Baseline testosterone levels from 596 women with PCOS who participated in a large, multicenter, randomized controlled infertility trial performed at academic health centers in the United States were run by varying assays, and results were compared.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
We measured assay precision and correlation and baseline Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism scores.


RESULTS
Median testosterone levels were highest with RIA. The correlations between the blinded samples that were run in duplicate were comparable. The correlation coefficient (CC) between LC/MS at Quest and Mayo was 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-0.85], between RIA and LC/MS at Mayo was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.82), and between RIA and LC/MS at Quest was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.63-0.72). Interassay variation was highest at the lower levels of total testosterone (≤50 ng/dl). The CC for Quest LC/MS was significantly different from those derived from the other assays. We found similar correlations between total testosterone levels and hirsutism score with the RIA (CC=0.24), LC/MS at Mayo (CC=0.15), or Quest (CC=0.17).

Low plasma sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations during pregnancy have been associated with the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Women presenting with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often exhibit low plasma SHBG concentration and are at increased risk of developing GDM. In this study, we investigate whether SHBG levels before conception are predictive of GDM in women with PCOS.


METHODS
A total of 50 women with PCOS were enrolled and followed up during pregnancy. Initial endocrine, metabolic and physical features were assessed according to a standardized preconception screening program. At 24-26 weeks of gestational age a 100-g glucose tolerance test was performed to screen for GDM.


RESULTS
Of the 50 women, 21 (42%) were diagnosed with GDM by a 100-g glucose tolerance test. Waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, plasma glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and SHBG levels before conception were significantly different between women who did and did not develop GDM. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that SHBG was the most significant predictive parameter for GDM (odds ratio 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.87-0.97), without significant contribution of waist circumference and HOMA-IR. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that plasma SHBG (area under the curve 0.86) had the highest predictive value for subsequent development of GDM, however, the limited group size did not allow for calculation of a threshold value of SHBG.


CONCLUSIONS
In women with PCOS, preconception SHBG levels are strongly associated with subsequent development of GDM. Regression and ROC analysis show that preconception SHBG levels may be a better predictor for GDM in PCOS women compared with waist circumference or HOMA-IR.

The age-specific prevalence of polycystic ovaries (PCO), as defined by the Rotterdam criteria, among normal ovulatory women, has not yet been reported. It is also uncertain whether these women differ from their peers in the hormonal or metabolic profile.


METHODS
A total of 262 ovulatory Caucasian women aged 25-45 yr, enrolled in a community-based ovarian aging study (OVA), underwent transvaginal ultrasound assessment of ovarian volume and antral follicle count (AFC) in the early follicular phase and were categorized as to whether they met the Rotterdam definition of PCO by AFC (≥12 in one ovary) and/or by volume (>10 cm(3) for one ovary). The effect of age on prevalence of PCO was assessed. Serum hormones and metabolic measures were compared between women meeting each element of the Rotterdam criterion and those without PCO using age-adjusted linear regressions.


RESULTS
The prevalence of PCO by AFC was 32% and decreased with age. Those with PCO by AFC had lower FSH; higher anti-Müllerian hormone, estrone, dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate, and free androgen index; and slightly higher total testosterone than those without PCO. However, slightly higher body mass index and waist circumference were the only metabolic differences. Women with PCO by volume had higher anti-Müllerian hormone and free androgen index but did not differ in any other hormonal or metabolic parameter.


DISCUSSION
PCO is a common, age-dependent finding among ovulatory women. These women lack the metabolic abnormalities seen in PCO syndrome. Isolated PCO in an ovulatory woman is not an indication for metabolic evaluation.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2010,187.0,"['Medicine', 'Biology']","[{'authorId': '14675757', 'name': 'E.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obesity are associated with cardiovascular disease, but it is unclear to what extent they contribute independently. Arterial stiffness might link obesity and PCOS to cardiovascular diseases.


OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to investigate whether PCOS in the presence or absence of obesity is linked with arterial stiffness.


DESIGN AND SETTING
We conducted a cross-sectional study, including 31 obese (18 with PCOS) and 39 lean (22 with PCOS) women.


INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Estimates of arterial stiffness were obtained by ultrasonography (distensibility and compliance of carotid, femoral, and brachial arteries; carotid elastic modulus; and intima-media thickness) and pulse wave transit time analyses (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and aortic augmentation index).


RESULTS
Obese women, with or without PCOS, had stiffer arteries than lean women. After adjustment for 24-h mean arterial pressure and age, obesity was inversely associated with the femoral, brachial, and carotid distensibility coefficients [β (95% confidence interval), -0.354 (-0.614 to -0.094), -0.354 (-0.547 to -0.161), and -0.248 (-0.370 to -0.126) 10(-3)/kPA, respectively] and with the femoral and carotid compliance coefficients [-0.296 (-0.563 to -0.029) and -0.190 (-0.377 to -0.003) mm(2)/kPA, respectively] but not with the brachial compliance coefficient [-0.018 (-0.052-0.015) mm(2)/kPA], Young's elastic modulus [0.049 (-0.005-0.103) kPA], aortic pulse wave velocity and aortic augmentation index [0.050 msec (-0.959-1.058 msec) and -1.831% (-8.196-4.534%), respectively]. Analyses with waist circumference as key independent variable gave broadly similar results. In contrast, PCOS was not associated with arterial stiffness estimates after adjustment for the presence of obesity.


CONCLUSIONS
In young obese women with PCOS, (central) obesity, rather than PCOS itself, is associated with increased arterial stiffness. These data emphasize that, from the perspective of cardiovascular risk reduction, the focus should be on central fat mass reduction in obese women with PCOS.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2010,58.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '10141191', 'name': 'I.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with metabolic disturbances which include impaired insulin signalling and glucose metabolism in ovarian follicles. The oocyte is metabolically dependent upon its follicle environment during development, but it is unclear whether PCOS or polycystic ovarian (PCO) morphology alone affect oocyte metabolism and energy-demanding processes such as meiosis.


METHODS
Immature human oocytes were donated by PCOS (n = 14), PCO (n = 14) and control (n = 46) patients attending the assisted conception programme at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Oocytes were cultured individually and carbohydrate metabolism was assessed during overnight in vitro maturation (IVM). Meiotic status was assessed and oocyte intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) content and mitochondria activity were measured prior to karyotype analysis by multifluor in situ hybridization.


RESULTS
Patient aetiology had no significant effect on oocyte maturation potential or incidence of numerical chromosome abnormalities (44%), although PCOS and PCO oocytes were more likely to suffer predivision. Group G chromosomes were most likely to be involved in non-disjunction and predivision. PCOS was associated with increased glucose consumption (2.06 +/- 0.43 and 0.54 +/- 0.12 pmol/h for PCOS and control oocytes, respectively) and increased pyruvate consumption (18.4 +/- 1.2 and 13.9 +/- 0.9 pmol/h for PCOS and control oocytes, respectively) during IVM. Prior prescription of metformin significantly attenuated pyruvate consumption by maturing oocytes (8.5 +/- 1.8 pmol/h) from PCOS patients. Oocytes from PCO patients had intermediate metabolism profiles. Higher pyruvate turnover was associated with abnormal oocyte karyotypes (13.4 +/- 1.9 and 19.9 +/- 2.1 pmol/h for normal versus abnormal oocytes, respectively). Similarly, oocyte NAD(P)H content was 1.35-fold higher in abnormal oocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
The chromosomal constitution of in vitro matured oocytes from PCOS is similar to that of controls, but aspects of oocyte metabolism are perturbed by PCOS. Elevated pyruvate consumption was associated with abnormal oocyte karyotype.",Human Reproduction,2010,57.0,"['Medicine', 'Biology']","[{'authorId': '117296395', 'name': 'S. E.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may have increased cortical bone mineral density (BMD) and probably higher bone material quality as well as better resistance in the compression strength of the tibia, measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), in comparison with that of age-matched healthy subjects.


METHODS
Thirty women with PCOS, (15 lean and 15 obese) and 15 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The clinical, biochemical and ultrasound characteristics of the two groups were evaluated. Using pQCT, the following parameters were measured: volumetric cortical density (CBD) and volumetric trabecular density (TBD) BMD, total bone cross-sectional area (ToA), cortical area (CoA), cortical thickness (CRT-THK-C) and finally the strength-strain index (SSI).


RESULTS
The geometrical parameters (CoA, ToA, CRT-THK-C), the SSI as well as the TBD were increased in the PCOS women; however, these differences did not achieve statistical significance between lean PCOS women, obese PCOS women, and controls. Conversely, CBD was significantly higher in PCOS women compared with controls (P < 0.000) and furthermore in lean PCOS women compared with obese ones (P < 0.01040).


CONCLUSIONS
The PCOS women of our study seem to have a higher quality of bone material in the distal tibia and probably a better resistance of bone in the compression strength without alterations in bone mass and geometry (especially the lean PCOS women), indicating that our oligomenorrheic and hyperandrogonemic PCOS women may be protected from the development of osteoporosis and fracture risk later in life.",Human Reproduction,2010,44.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4609528', 'name': 'D.

Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are intrinsically insulin resistant and have a high risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Weight loss improves risk factors, but the optimal diet composition is unknown. Low-glycemic index (low-GI) diets are recommended without evidence of their clinical effectiveness.


OBJECTIVE
We compared changes in insulin sensitivity and clinical outcomes after similar weight losses after consumption of a low-GI diet compared with a conventional healthy diet in women with PCOS.


DESIGN
We assigned overweight and obese premenopausal women with PCOS (n = 96) to consume either an ad libitum low-GI diet or a macronutrient-matched healthy diet and followed the women for 12 mo or until they achieved a 7% weight loss. We compared changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity, which we assessed using the insulin sensitivity index derived from the oral-glucose-tolerance test (ISI(OGTT)); glucose tolerance; body composition; plasma lipids; reproductive hormones; health-related quality of life; and menstrual cycle regularity.


RESULTS
The attrition rate was high in both groups (49%). Among completers, ISI(OGTT) improved more with the low-GI diet than with the conventional healthy diet (mean +/- SEM: 2.2 +/- 0.7 compared with 0.7 +/- 0.6, respectively; P = 0.03). There was a significant diet-metformin interaction (P = 0.048), with greater improvement in ISI(OGTT) among women prescribed both metformin and the low-GI diet. Compared with women who consumed the conventional healthy diet, more women who consumed the low-GI diet showed improved menstrual cyclicity (95% compared with 63%, respectively; P = 0.03). Among the biochemical measures, only serum fibrinogen concentrations showed significant differences between diets (P < 0.05).

Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is increased in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting a delay in ovarian aging. We examined AMH levels in PCOS and normo-ovulatory women in a population-based cohort over a period of 10 years and used this information to estimate their menopausal age.


METHODS
Of a subset of 1002 non-menopausal women randomly selected from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, 85 cases of PCOS were diagnosed. We frequency-matched our control subjects with PCOS cases based on age and BMI. AMH levels were assessed at the time of recruitment (T1) and twice after that (T2 and T3). AMH levels were then plotted against age of the individual at the time of the measurement and the most appropriate model was selected. Menopause was calculated based on AMH levels below 0.2 ng/ml.


RESULTS
AMH levels were significantly higher in PCOS cases compared with controls at the beginning of the study (5.58 +/- 3.64 versus 4.35 +/- 2.90 ng/ml, P = 0.03), but the difference diminished considerably in subsequent assessments. The rate of AMH decline in PCOS cases decreased in the second compared with the first interval; however, no apparent change in the rate of decline was observed in controls. Estimated ages at menopause were 51 [95% confidence interval (CI), 34-81] and 49 (95% CI, 38-63) years in PCOS cases and controls, respectively.

METHODS A literature search was conducted (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, clinical trial registries and hand-searching) identifying studies reporting prevalence or incidence of IGT, DM2 or metabolic syndrome in women with and without PCOS. Data were presented as odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] with fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis by Mantel-Haenszel methods. Quality testing was based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scaling and The Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias assessment tool. Literature searching, data abstraction and quality appraisal were performed by two investigators. RESULTS A total of 2192 studies were reviewed and 35 were selected for final analysis. Women with PCOS had increased prevalence of IGT (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.63, 3.77; BMI-matched studies OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.44, 4.47), DM2 (OR 4.43, 95% CI 4.06, 4.82; BMI-matched studies OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.97, 8.10) and metabolic syndrome (OR 2.88, 95% CI 2.40, 3.45; BMI-matched studies OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.36, 3.56).

METHODS Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used for retrospective analysis of clinical, sonographic and endocrinological parameters collected prior to the start of ovarian stimulation in a cohort of anovulatory World Health Organization (WHO) Group II patients (n = 335), who were resistant to clomiphene citrate (CC) and therefore stimulated with gonadotrophins using a low-dose step-up protocol. RESULTS The univariate analysis identified age [OR = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84–0.98), P = 0.015], duration of infertility [OR = 0.71 (95% CI: 0.56–0.91), P = 0.007], serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration at the start of stimulation [OR = 0.83 (95% CI: 0.69–0.99), P = 0.034] and menstrual cycle pattern (P = 0.022) as significant predictors of live birth. Baseline concentrations of luteinizing hormone, androgens, glucose and insulin, as well as body mass index, were not predictors of live birth. In the multivariate analysis, duration of infertility, FSH and menstrual cycle pattern were independent predictors, and nomograms were designed with these three parameters for individual prediction of the probability of live birth. CONCLUSIONS The chances of live birth in women with WHO Group II anovulatory infertility resistant to CC undergoing ovulation induction with gonadotrophins is highly influenced by the menstrual cycle pattern.

The characteristics of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) such as hyperandrogenism and anovulation can be highly stressful and might negatively affect psychological well-being and sexuality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between PCOS characteristics and psychological well-being as well as sexarche.


METHODS
Patients (n = 1148) underwent standardized clinical evaluation. Psychological well-being was investigated in 480 patients with the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES), the body cathexis scale (BCS) and the fear of negative appearance evaluation scale (FNAES). Sexarche was also assessed.


RESULTS
Amenorrhoea was associated with lower self-esteem (P = 0.03), greater fear of negative appearance evaluation (P = 0.01) and earlier sexarche (P= 0.004). Hyperandrogenism and acne were associated with poorer body satisfaction (P = 0.03, 0.02, respectively).

29,42cf7ee94acc5b9978fdb3caf5e7c3bde8f05f74,Maternal metabolism and obesity: modifiable determinants of pregnancy outcome.,"BACKGROUND
Obesity among pregnant women is highly prevalent worldwide and is associated in a linear manner with markedly increased risk of adverse outcome for mother and infant. Obesity in the mother may also independently confer risk of obesity to her child. The role of maternal metabolism in determining these outcomes and the potential for lifestyle modification are largely unknown.


METHODS
Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, the metaRegister of clinical trials and Google Scholar without limitations. Sensitive search strategies were combined with relevant medical subject headings and text words.


RESULTS
Maternal obesity and gestational weight gain have a significant impact on maternal metabolism and offspring development. Insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis, fat oxidation and amino acid synthesis are all disrupted by maternal obesity and contribute to adverse outcomes. Modification of lifestyle is an effective intervention strategy for improvement of maternal metabolism and the prevention of type 2 diabetes and, potentially, gestational diabetes.


CONCLUSIONS
Maternal obesity requires the development of effective interventions to improve pregnancy outcome.

Anxiety and depression are more prevalent in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) than in those without this disorder. Possible confounding effects of overweight and obesity are suggested. The aim was to compare symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with PCOS and controls matched for age, body weight and body mass index (BMI).


METHODS
Women with PCOS (n = 30) and controls (n = 30) were recruited from the community. Persons with ongoing psychotropic medication were excluded. All potential participants underwent gynecological examination to confirm case-control status. Participants completed the self-reported versions of the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA-S) and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S).


RESULTS
Women with PCOS had a higher BSA-S score compared with controls (median, range: 10.5, 1-24 versus 5.0, 0-28, P < 0.001). They scored higher on the following four individual symptoms: reduced sleep (2.0, 0-5 versus 0, 0-2, P < 0.001), worry (1.5, 0-4 versus 0, 0-6, P = 0.004), phobias (1, 0-4 versus 0, 0-3, P < 0.001), and pain (1, 0-3 versus 0, 0-2, P < 0.001). No statistical difference was demonstrated regarding MADRS-S scores (10.0, 0-27 versus 5.5, 0-24, P = 0.053). Only one of the nine MADRS-S symptoms, reduced sleep, which is also included in the BSA-S, differed between cases and controls.


CONCLUSIONS
Several anxiety symptoms distinguished women with PCOS from a control group matched on BMI. A better understanding of the symptoms is needed to identify and alleviate anxiety symptoms in this vulnerable group.",Human Reproduction,2010,155.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '8478190', 'name': 'E.

Generic patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures underestimate the impact of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on quality of life (QoL). The aim of this review was to identify PCOS-specific QoL measures and establish whether their development history and measurement properties support their use in clinical trials.


METHODS
A systematic search was conducted using terms synonymous with ""PCOS"" and ""QoL."" Following identification of measures, further searches were undertaken using the questionnaire name and abbreviation to explore its use, development history, and demonstrated measurement properties.


RESULTS
Of 56 abstracts screened, 21 reported using PRO measures. One PCOS-specific QoL measure was identified: the PolyCystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire (PCOSQ). Nine papers show that the PCOSQ's development history is somewhat incomplete, and that it does not have good content validity. The PCOSQ subscales demonstrate acceptable levels of reliability (0.70-0.97) and partial known-groups validity as well as convergent/divergent validity with other PRO instruments. Responsiveness to change is variable and minimally important differences have not been established.


CONCLUSIONS
The PCOSQ is the only condition-specific measure of the impact of PCOS on QoL. Additional research is required to ensure its comprehensiveness, sensitivity, and to guide interpretation prior to including in clinical trials.",Value in Health,2008,27.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1402226378', 'name': 'Aysha Malik-Aslam'}, {'authorId': '11297959', 'name': 'M.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by anovulation, hyperandrogaenemia and insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinaemia is associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk and the development of diabetes mellitus. If insulin sensitising agents such as metformin are effective in treating features of PCOS, then they could have wider health benefits than just treating the symptoms of the syndrome.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effectiveness of insulin sensitising drugs in improving reproductive outcomes and metabolic parameters for women with PCOS and menstrual disturbance.


SEARCH STRATEGY
We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders & Subfertility Group trials register (searched September 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, third Quarter 2008), CINAHL (searched September 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2008), and EMBASE (January 1985 to September 2008). All searches were rerun 13 August 2009 17 RCTs were located and await classification.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials which investigated the effect of insulin sensitising drugs compared with either placebo or no treatment, or compared with an ovulation induction agent.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Thirty one trials (2537 women) were included for analysis, 27 of them using metformin and involving 2150 women.


MAIN RESULTS
There is no evidence that metformin improves live birth rates whether it is used alone (Pooled OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.39) or in combination with clomiphene (Pooled OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.95). However, clinical pregnancy rates are improved for metformin versus placebo (Pooled OR = OR 3.86, 95% C.I. 2.18 to 6.84) and for metformin and clomiphene versus clomiphene alone (Pooled OR =1.48, 95% C.I. 1.12 to 1.95) ). In the studies that compared metformin and clomiphene alone, there was no evidence of an improved live birth rate (OR= 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.02) but the pooled OR resulted in improved clinical pregnancy rate in in the clomiphene group (OR = 0.63 , 95% 0.43 to 0.92), although there was significant heterogeneity.There is also evidence that ovulation rates are improved with metformin in women with PCOS for metformin versus placebo (Pooled OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.50 to 3.0) and for metformin and clomiphene versus clomiphene alone (Pooled OR = 3.46, 95% CI 1.97 to 6.07).Metformin was also associated with a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance, but no serious adverse effects were reported.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
In agreement with the previous review, metformin is still of benefit in improving clinical pregnancy and ovulation rates. However, there is no evidence that metformin improves live birth rates whether it is used alone or in combination with clomiphene, or when compared with clomiphene. Therefore, the use of metformin in improving reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS appears to be limited.",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2010,464.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2250172', 'name': 'T.

Ovaries meeting criteria for polycystic ovary morphology during peak reproductive years may no longer meet the criteria with age.


OBJECTIVE
Ovarian volume and follicle number decrease with age in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), permitting age-dependent criteria for PCOM.


DESIGN AND SETTING
We conducted longitudinal (7-15 year interval) and cross-sectional studies to examine polycystic ovarian morphology over time at an outpatient clinic and pathology laboratory in a tertiary care hospital.


PATIENTS
Subjects included those with PCOS defined by the National Institutes of Health criteria (n = 11 and 483 for longitudinal and cross-sectional, respectively) and control women with regular menstrual cycles and no hyperandrogenism (n = 15 and 367), age 18-64 yr.


INTERVENTIONS
Subjects underwent an ovarian ultrasound by a single observer.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Ovarian volume and follicle number were measured and ultrasound findings confirmed by a pathologist in a subset (n = 9).


RESULTS
Ovarian volume (15.2 +/- 7.4 vs. 7.1 +/- 3.7 ml; P < 0.01) and follicle number (12.8 +/- 3.2 vs. 8.1 +/- 3.9; P < 0.05) decreased longitudinally in PCOS and control women (volume 11.6 +/- 4.4 vs. 5.4 +/- 2.2 ml and follicle number 8.3 +/- 1.9 vs. 6.3 +/- 1.8; both P < 0.005). Using cross-sectional data, log ovarian volume and follicle number decreased in both groups, but the decrease in log ovarian volume was less pronounced in women with PCOS than in controls (P < 0.01). A combination of age, log ovarian volume, follicle number, and testosterone distinguished PCOS subjects from controls with a receiver operator characteristic curve area of 0.90.


CONCLUSIONS
Ovarian volume and follicle number decrease with age in women with PCOS and controls necessitating age-based criteria to define polycystic ovarian morphology.

This paper is a report of a study to explore the experiences of women with polycystic ovary syndrome attending a nurse-led support group.


BACKGROUND
Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common chronic endocrine disorder associated with high levels of psychological distress. It has been argued that healthcare providers should regularly review the psychological health of women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and that nurses can help women to adjust to the condition by providing education and support. Little is known about the means of providing social support for women with the syndrome, or of any benefits for patients.


METHOD
Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 female patients in 2006. The patients attended a support group at a public hospital in the United Kingdom. The data were analysed using deductive and inductive thematic analysis.


FINDINGS
The group provided both socio-emotional and informational social support. Participants reported that attending the group helped to reduce isolation, and provided an opportunity for social comparison and accessible and personally relevant information. Participants described the group as having had a major personal impact for them. They reported feeling empowered and direct positive effects on their self-management behaviours.


CONCLUSION
Social support appears to be a key factor mediating the psychosocial impact in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Healthcare providers should consider running such support groups or referring patients to them. Providing social support may alleviate distress and improve self-management.",Journal of Advanced Nursing,2009,64.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '46779630', 'name': 'C.

Elevated serum levels of high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) reflect low-grade chronic inflammation and have been associated with several insulin-resistant states; they are useful cardiovascular risk markers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether soluble inflammatory markers are altered in PCOS focusing on its relationship with obesity and indexes of insulin resistance. Patients and methods: One hundred and eight women with PCOS and 75 healthy women were recruited. Patients were divided according to body mass index (BMI) into two groups; group I (BMI < 27 kg/m2) and group II (BMI ≥ 27 Kg/m2). Serum levels of hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α, lipid and hormone profiles were measured. Results: PCOS patients had increased levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), androstendione, insulin level and HOMA index compared to healthy BMI matched controls. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations were significantly reduced in both patient groups compared to their controls, while triglyceride levels were significantly increased in obese group compared to controls. There were no significant difference in serum inflammatory markers hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α between group I and their matched controls. On the other hand, there were significant increase in these markers between group II and their matched controls. There were highly significant positive correlation between hs-CRP and IL-6 (r = 0.702, P < 0.001) and between hs-CRP and TNF-α (r = 0.621, P <0.001), also between IL-6 and TNF-α (r = 0.543, P < 0.001). These inflammatory markers correlated significantly with BMI and HOMA index. Multiple regression analysis revealed that BMI and HOMA were predictors of IL-6 levels (b = 11.173, P < 0.001, b = 13.564, P < 0.001 respectively) and BMI was the only predictor of hs-CRP levels (b = 12.578, P < 0.001) and TNF-α levels (b = 0.134, P < 0.001). Conclusion: PCOS and obesity induce an increase in serum inflammatory cardiovascular risk markers. The precise mechanisms underlying these associations require additional studies to clarify the state of the cardiovascular system in women with PCOS compared with controls in large numbers of patients to determine the relative contribution of different factors including insulin resistance, androgen status and BMI.",Disease Markers,2009,124.0,"['Medicine', 'Biology']","[{'authorId': '4119344', 'name': 'N.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. The selection of first-line therapies for ovulation induction is empiric.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of the study was to develop a clinically useful predictive model of live birth with varying ovulation induction methods.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
We built four prognostic models from a large multicenter randomized controlled infertility trial of 626 women with PCOS performed at academic health centers in the United States to predict success of ovulation, conception, pregnancy, and live birth, evaluating the influence of patients' baseline characteristics.


INTERVENTIONS
Ovulation was induced with clomiphene, metformin, or the combination of both for up to six cycles or conception.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
The primary outcome of the trial was the rate of live births.


RESULTS
Baseline free androgen index, baseline proinsulin level, interaction of treatment arm with body mass index, and duration of attempting conception were significant predictors in all four models. History of a prior loss predicted ovulation and conception, but not pregnancy or live birth. A modified Ferriman Gallwey hirsutism score of less than 8 was predictive of conception, pregnancy, and live birth (although it did not predict ovulation success). Age was a divergent predictor based on outcome; age greater than 34 predicted ovulation, whereas age less than 35 was a predictive factor for a successful pregnancy and live birth. Smoking history had no predictive value.


CONCLUSIONS
A live birth prediction chart developed from basic clinical parameters (body mass index, age, hirsutism score, and duration of attempting conception) may help physicians counsel and select infertility treatments for women with PCOS.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2009,70.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '5499396', 'name': 'M.

To assess the prevalence of depression and psychologic disorders and their effect on the quality of life in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.


METHODS
We performed a PubMed search of major relevant articles published during the period from 1985 to 2009 dealing with polycystic ovary syndrome, associated psychologic morbidity, and the relationship to clinical and biochemical changes affecting the quality of life.


RESULTS
In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, the presence of depression and allied disorders was frequently noted to diminish mental well-being, affect, and self-worth. The symptoms often associated with this syndrome, such as hirsutism, obesity, irregular menses, and subfertility, were a major source of psychologic morbidity. Obesity was the most prevalent cause of mental distress, whereas other features such as hirsutism and infertility were less well defined as major factors. Although the findings in some studies have been inconclusive, the presence of clinically significant eating disorders and a 7-fold increase in the suicide rate have been reported in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.


CONCLUSION
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome have a high risk for depression and affective disorders that impair their quality of life. The presence of obesity, eating disorders, hirsutism, poor self-image, and a significant suicide rate makes evaluation of their emotional state an integral part of their assessment and treatment. For adequate treatment of the woman with polycystic ovary syndrome, a biopsychosocial model should be used, with all aspects of the patient's mental status considered before implementation of optimal intervention.",Endocrine Practice,2009,46.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '15284039', 'name': 'S.

Of the recently identified type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) susceptibility loci, transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) confers the greatest relative risk for T2D and significantly predicts conversion to T2D in persons with impaired glucose tolerance. TCF7L2 is, therefore, also a strong candidate gene for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder characterized by androgen excess and menstrual irregularities and associated with insulin resistance and a 7-fold increased risk for T2D.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We tested for association between 58 single nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to TCF7L2 and PCOS in 624 index (PCOS) cases and 553 control women of European ancestry. Furthermore, in the women with PCOS, we tested for association with seven reproductive and metabolic quantitative traits.


RESULTS
Although we did not detect evidence for association between the previously described TCF7L2 T2D locus, the proinsulin:insulin molar ratio, a marker of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, was strongly associated with this locus (P = 2.1 x 10(-4)). We also observed evidence for association between PCOS and two single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs11196236 (P = 9.0 x 10(-4)) and rs11196229 (P = 0.0027) mapping more than 100 kb centromeric to the previously published T2D susceptibility loci.


CONCLUSIONS
We have observed evidence of association with two independent TCF7L2 loci in a PCOS cohort: 1) association between the proinsulin:insulin molar ratio and the T2D locus; and 2) association with reproductive PCOS phenotype and a novel locus. This study suggests that variation in different regions of a susceptibility gene contributes to distinct phenotypes.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2009,58.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '5290611', 'name': 'A.

There are numerous diagnostic criteria generating several reproductive diagnostic phenotypes [National Institute of Health (NIH) hyperandrogenic anovulatory PCOS and non-NIH PCOS including hyperandrogenic ovulatory or non-hyperandrogenic anovulatory PCOS]. There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal diagnostic criteria for PCOS and on the metabolic implications of newer non-NIH PCOS phenotypes. METHODS We reviewed the literature on the presence of risk factors for type 2 diabetes (DM2) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) across the reproductive diagnostic phenotypes of PCOS with the aims of comparing the metabolic features of the NIH and non-NIH groups and identifying potential high metabolic risk phenotypes of PCOS. RESULTS NIH PCOS patients present with greater obesity, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance (IR) and risk factors for DM2 and CVD compared with non-NIH ovulatory and non-hyperandrogenic PCOS patients. Where differences in metabolic features exist between the phenotypes, they are generally related to the degree of total and abdominal obesity. There is emerging evidence suggesting ovulatory and non-hyperandrogenic PCOS have greater metabolic abnormalities than controls primarily linked to abdominal adiposity. There is currently no evidence that non-hyperandrogenic PCOS is associated with a less adverse metabolic profile than ovulatory PCOS. CONCLUSIONS Current metabolic evidence appears to justify the inclusion of both non-NIH PCOS groups (ovulatory and non-hyperandrogenic) as PCOS subgroups.

Comparatively little attention has been paid to the symptoms of anxiety in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), although anxiety disorders constitute the most common psychiatric diagnoses among endocrine patients and in the general population. Therefore, our goal was to address the prevalence, determinants and implications of anxiety alone or anxiety in combination with depression in German women with PCOS.


METHODS
In this nation-wide, internet-based survey, anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS) and quality of life (SF-12) were assessed together with sociodemographic information and clinical PCOS symptoms in 448 PCOS women.


RESULTS
Of the patients, 34% showed clinically relevant HADS anxiety scores and 21% had clinically relevant HADS depression scores. Quality of life was significantly impaired in PCOS women with anxiety (P < 0.001), in particular, in women with comorbid anxiety and depression (P < 0.001). The risk for clinically relevant HADS anxiety scores was significantly enhanced in PCOS women with acne (odds ratio (OR) = 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-2.52) and an unfulfilled wish to conceive (OR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.01-2.23).


CONCLUSIONS
PCOS women may be at an increased risk for clinically relevant anxiety, and comorbid anxiety and depression is also very common. Anxiety contributes to impaired quality of life in PCOS. Given the high prevalence and the serious implications, and the availability of effective treatment options given proper diagnosis, clinicians should be more aware of anxiety disorders in women with PCOS.",Human Reproduction,2009,147.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '8394002', 'name': 'S.

The present study aimed to assess a range of circulating markers of endothelial function in overweight women with and without PCOS. Overweight and obese age- and BMI (body mass index)-matched women with (n=80) and without (n=27) PCOS were assessed in a cross-sectional study. End-point measures were HOMA (homoeostasis model assessment)-IR, androgens, lipids, inflammatory markers [hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein)] and endothelial function [FMD (flow-mediated dilation), ADMA (asymmetric dimethylarginine), PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) and vWF (von Willebrand factor)]. Women with PCOS had elevated HOMA-IR (4.1+/-3.4 compared with 1.9+/-1.4), free androgen index (9.3+/-5.6 compared with 4.6+/-3.8), total cholesterol (5.2+/-1.0 compared with 4.7+/-0.9 mmol/l) and triacylglycerols (triglycerides; 1.4+/-0.7 compared with 0.9+/-0.3 mmol/l) (P<0.05 for all), but similar hsCRP compared with women without PCOS. With regard to endothelial function, women with PCOS had elevated ADMA (1.0+/-0.4 compared 0.3+/-0.1 mumol/l, P<0.001) and PAI-1 (5.6+/-1.8 compared with 4.6+/-1.1 units/ml, P=0.006), a trend towards worsened FMD (11.8+/-5.0 compared with 13.5+/-4.0%, P=0.075) and no difference in vWF compared with controls. For all subjects, ADMA (P=0.002) and PAI-1 (P<0.001) were increased with higher tertiles of HOMA-IR. Women with PCOS are hyperandrogenic, dyslipidaemic and have IR, and have risk factors for CVD and diabetes including increased circulating markers of endothelial function (ADMA and PAI-1) and a trend towards worse FMD as a global marker of endothelial function.

The purpose of the present study was to examine long-term reproductive outcome and ovarian reserve in an unselected population of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS A total of 91 patients with confirmed PCOS and 87 healthy controls were included in the study. Patients had been diagnosed between 1987 and 1995 and at the time of the follow-up, subjects were 35 years of age or older.


RESULTS
Among women who had attempted a pregnancy, 86.7% of PCOS patients and 91.6% of controls had given birth to at least one child. Among PCOS patients who had given birth, 73.6% had done so following a spontaneous conception. Mean ovarian volume and the number of antral follicles in PCOS patients were significantly greater than in control women (P < 0.001, respectively). PCOS patients also had higher serum concentrations of anti-Müllerian hormone and lower follicle-stimulating hormone levels.


CONCLUSIONS
Most women with PCOS had given birth, and the rate of spontaneous pregnancies was relatively high.

Specifically addressed are the impact of gestational weight gain on perinatal risk, the increased risk of congenital anomalies in offspring, developmental origins of health and disease in offspring, and reproductive issues following bariatric surgery. Recent findings Limiting maternal weight gain in obese women to less than 15 lb may favorably attenuate perinatal risk (macrosomia, cesarean delivery, preeclampsia) but increase risk for small-for-gestational-age newborns. Obese women are at significantly increased risk for offspring to develop open neural tube defects and congenital heart disease as well as other anomalies. Impaired sonographic visualization in this population may impede prenatal diagnosis of these serious birth defects. Intrauterine nutritional overabundance may cue adaptive fetal responses predisposing to childhood and adult obesity as well as the metabolic syndrome. Bariatric surgery, the only effective treatment for morbid obesity, causes lifelong physiologic and anatomic changes associated with significant reproductive implications. Procedures can predispose to caloric and micronutrient deficiencies, improved fertility and fecundity, and late surgical complications. Pregnancy outcomes are typically similar to those of women without previous bariatric surgery and better than those of untreated morbidly obese women. Summary Obesity and its surgical treatment are associated with lifelong health implications for the mother as well as her offspring. An appreciation of these obesity-related reproductive issues is critical for optimal care of this growing segment of the female population.",Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology,2009,61.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '3003159', 'name': 'J.

AMH levels were evaluated in four age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched groups of 25 normal-weight and 25 obese or overweight women each, belonging to the four main subsets of the syndrome resulting from combinations of the three diagnostic criteria [group 1: oligo- and/or anovulation (ANOV), hyperandrogenemia (HA), and polycystic ovaries (PCO) on ultrasonographic evaluation; group 2: ANOV and HA; group 3: HA and PCO, group 4: ANOV and PCO], and in 50 (25 obese or overweight and 25 normal weight) age- and BMI-matched healthy control subjects. Age, BMI, waist circumference, FSH, LH, prolactin, testosterone, Delta(4)-androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, 17alpha-OH-progesterone, fasting insulin, glucose, AMH, free androgen index, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance index were analyzed. AMH levels were significantly higher in PCOS groups 1 and 2 compared with groups 3 and 4 and the control group and higher in PCOS groups 3 and 4 compared with the control group. AMH levels were significantly increased in normal-weight compared with obese and overweight women. AMH concentrations were independently predicted, in order of significance, by LH and testosterone levels, BMI (negatively), and the total number of follicles 2-9 mm in diameter. The differences in circulating AMH levels between the main phenotypic groups of PCOS women appear to reflect the severity of the syndrome, but are negatively affected by obesity.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with metabolic abnormalities. It is debated whether all women with PCOS should be screened for metabolic abnormalities as these may vary with PCOS phenotype, age and ethnicity. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities in Dutch anovulatory PCOS women and to define criteria for metabolic screening.


METHODS
Anovulatory patients, diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam consensus criteria, underwent metabolic screening. Through stepwise multivariate analysis patient characteristics associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and insulin resistance (IR) were evaluated for their use as selection parameters for metabolic screening.


RESULTS
Overall, prevalence of MetS and IR was 15.9% (n = 25) and 14% (n = 22), respectively, in 157 PCOS women (age 29.0 +/- 4.8 years, BMI 26.1 +/- 6.7 kg/m(2)). Anovulatory hyperandrogenic women (with or without polycystic ovaries) had more often MetS and IR (with, 20.8 and 19.8%; without, 100 and 40%, respectively) than non-hyperandrogenic PCOS women (0 and 1.8%; P < 0.001). Waist circumference >83.5 cm along with increased free androgen index (FAI) had the most powerful association with the presence of MetS and IR (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.912) and offered a reduction in the necessity of screening for metabolic derailments of about 50%.


CONCLUSIONS
The hyperandrogenic PCOS phenotypes are highly linked to the presence of MetS and IR in Dutch PCOS women.

Peripubertal obesity (body mass index-for-age >or= 95%) in girls is associated with hyperandrogenemia. LH likely contributes to this relationship, but overnight LH secretion in obese girls is poorly characterized.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of the study was to evaluate LH pulse characteristics in obese girls throughout pubertal maturation.


DESIGN
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis.


SETTING
The study was performed in a general clinical research center.


PARTICIPANTS
Eight nonobese and five obese Tanner 1-2 girls participated, as well as 32 nonobese and 12 obese Tanner 3-5 girls.


INTERVENTION
Blood samples were collected every 10 min overnight (from 1900 to 0700 h).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
LH pulse frequency, amplitude, and mean LH were measured in three 4-h time blocks (block 1, 1900-2300 h; block 2, 2300-0300 h; and block 3, 0300-0700 h).


RESULTS
Tanner stage 1-2 nonobese girls demonstrated nocturnal increases of LH frequency (P < 0.01, block 1 vs. 2) and mean LH (P < 0.05, block 1 vs. 2 and 3). Obese Tanner 1-2 girls had lower 12-h LH frequency and LH amplitude (P < 0.05 for both), with no overnight changes of LH pulse parameters. Compared to normal, LH frequency was elevated in Tanner 3-5 obese girls (P < 0.01 in all blocks), whereas LH amplitude was low (P < 0.05 in all blocks). Overnight increases of LH amplitude were observed in nonobese Tanner 3-5 girls (P < 0.0001), but not in obese Tanner 3-5 girls.


CONCLUSIONS
Obesity in prepubertal and early pubertal girls is associated with reduced LH secretion and reduced nocturnal changes of LH. In later pubertal girls, obesity is linked with reduced LH amplitude, but elevated LH frequency; the latter may reflect effects of hyperandrogenemia.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2009,102.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '3390517', 'name': 'C.

Some PCOS women have the increased leptin concentration in blood serum. Leptin concentration is higher in patients with high body mass index (BMI) and impaired tissue sensitivity to insulin. The aim of this study was to determine leptin concentrations in PCOS patients before and after metformin treatment depending on BMI, insulin resistance calculated on the basis of the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index, as well as concentrations of androgens: testosterone and androstendion. Such values as BMI, insulin resistance according to the HOMA index, and concentrations of androstendion, testosterone and leptin were determined in 35 patients with PCOS before and after 3-month metformin treatment administered in daily doses of 2 x 850 mg. Increased leptin levels before the therapy were observed in 91.3% (21 out of 23) of obese patients, in 75% (9 out of 12) non-obese patients, in 100% (8 patients) insulin resistance women, in 81.5% (22 out of 27) insulin sensitive patients, in 94.7% (18 out of 19) women with elevated androstendion concentration and in 75% (12 out of 16) with normal androstendion concentration, in 93.7% (15 out of 16) patients with increased testosterone concentration and in 78.9% (15 out of 19) patients with testosterone concentrations within the normal range. After treatment statistically significant decrease in leptin concentration was obtained in the patients with BMI<or=25, insulin-sensitive patients (HOMA<3.8) and patients whose testosterone and androstendion concentrations stayed within normal limits. Increased leptin concentrations may be one of the elements of PCOS clinical picture.

To assess the prevalence of cardiovascular events in an older population of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).


METHODS
We took advantage of the high heritability of PCOS and determined the probable PCOS status of mothers of women with PCOS. The prevalence of cardiovascular events was then determined in these mothers with and without PCOS. In a single endocrine clinic, 308 women with PCOS were interviewed about their mothers' medical history, and the mothers themselves were interviewed if available. The interview addressed menstrual history, fertility, clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, age at incident cardiovascular event, and age at death as reported by daughters. Presence of PCOS in the mothers was defined as a history of infertility, irregular menses, or clinical signs of hyperandrogenism. A cardiovascular event was defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, any coronary intervention, angina necessitating emergency department visits, or a cerebrovascular event.


RESULTS
The mothers were predominantly post-menopausal. Among 182 interviewed (n = 157) or deceased (n = 25) mothers, 59 had probable PCOS. Cardiovascular events were more common (P = .011) among mothers with PCOS (11 of 59 or 18.6%) than among non-PCOS mothers (5 of 123 or 4.1%). After adjustments were made for age and race, probable PCOS was an independent predictor of cardiovascular events (odds ratio, 5.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.78 to 16.40). Cardiovascular events occurred at an early age in mothers of women with PCOS, particularly mothers with probable PCOS themselves.


CONCLUSION
PCOS-affected mothers of women with PCOS have a higher risk for cardiovascular events in comparison with non-PCOS mothers, and cardiovascular events appear to occur at an earlier than expected age in mothers with PCOS.",Endocrine Practice,2008,28.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '8619282', 'name': 'K.

In polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women, the changes in body appearance (mainly obesity and hirsutism) may influence the feminine identity of the patients with consequent depression and sexual disturbances.


AIM
To evaluate if lean PCOS patients present an increased incidence of depression and sexual dysfunction in comparison with controls and if clitoral volume and vascularization are influenced by circulating androgens levels.


METHODS
25 lean PCOS women (Group I) and 18 healthy nonhirsute volunteers (Group II) were submitted, on day 3-5 of the cycle, to ultrasonographic and Doppler analyses, and to hormonal and biochemical evaluations.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Utero-ovarian and clitoral ultrasonographic analysis, and color Doppler evaluation of the uterine, stromal ovarian, and dorsal clitoral arteries. Hormonal and nitrites/nitrates plasma concentrations were analyzed. Each woman filled in the 2-factor Italian McCoy female questionnaire (MFSQ) and the Beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire (BDI).


RESULTS
Androgens resulted, as expected, more elevated in PCOS patients than in controls. However, the ultrasonographic (US) assessment of the clitoral body volume evidenced no significant differences between PCOS (0.72+/-0.41 mL) and control (0.62+/-0.20 mL) patients. The resistances registered at the level of the dorsal clitoral artery did not show any difference between Group I (PI=1.55+/-0.40) and Group II (PI=1.79+/-0.38). The 2-factor Italian MFSQ and the BDI did not show any difference between PCOS women and controls.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), though initially manifesting with reproductive and cosmetic symptoms is a harbinger of insulin resistance syndrome. It is associated with psychological distress in both management as well as in its etiology. There are no Indian studies on psychological stress in women with PCOS.


METHODS
Ninety nine women who presented with PCOS to the Endocrinology clinic were administered Goldberg's GHQ 28 (General Health Questionnaire) to assess psychological status, along with clinical, hormonal and ultrasound evaluation.


RESULTS
Fifty four percent had a GHQ28 score >8. Among them 38% had a family size <4, 72% had obesity, 70% had hirsutism, 72% had a waist circumference >88 cm and 69% had a F/G score >4 . All these variables were statistically significant; p < 0.05 using Chi-square test.

A case-control study observes the population more efficiently by using a sample of the population, which becomes the control series, in place of complete assessment of the denominators of the disease frequencies. This extra sampling step can make a case-control study much more efficient than a cohort study of the same population, but it introduces a number of subtleties and avenues for bias that are absent in typical cohort studies. For diseases that are sufficiently rare, cohort studies become impractical, and case-control studies become the only useful alternative.



The cases in a case-control study should be the same people who would be considered cases in a cohort study of the same population. The definition of the source population for these cases determines the population from which controls should be sampled. Ideally, control selection would involve direct sampling from the source population, with equal probability of selection, although in many circumstances, variations in and substitutes for this ideal sampling design may be considered.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) suffer from anovulatory infertility and hospital-based studies suggest that they have an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Our aim was to investigate the proportion of women, with self-reported oligo-amenorrhea and/or hirsutism in a general population, who had suffered from infertility, the percentage of them managing to conceive and their rate of spontaneous abortion.


METHODS
At age 31, a postal questionnaire including questions about hirsutism and oligo-amenorrhea was sent to all women from the population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (total n = 5889). Of these, 4535 (79.5%) answered the questionnaire, 1103 reported hirsutism and/or oligo/amenorrhea (symptomatic women) and 3420 were non-symptomatic. The fecundability ratio (FR) was defined as the probability of conception of a clinically detectable pregnancy within 12 months.


RESULTS
The overall pregnancy (77.7% versus 75.6%) and spontaneous abortion (19.3% versus 18.6%) rates did not differ between the two groups and the risk of spontaneous abortion was not associated with body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) or waist circumference. Symptomatic women had suffered more often from infertility than non-symptomatic women (19.4% versus 11.1%, P < 0.01). Oligo-amenorrhea and/or hirsutism (FR = 0.74, P < 0.001) and obesity (FR = 0.68, P = 0.002) were both independently associated with decreased fecundability, but symptomatic women had become pregnant and had one or two successful deliveries as often as non-symptomatic women.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy of uncertain etiology but with strong evidence for a genetic contribution.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that the typical polycystic ovarian morphology is a marker of inherited biochemical features in families of women with PCOS.


DESIGN
A study of probands with PCOS and their sisters.


PATIENTS
Patients included 125 probands and 214 sisters. All probands had PCOS, defined by symptoms of anovulation and/or hyperandrogenism with polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Affected sisters were defined by polycystic ovaries, regardless of symptoms, and unaffected sisters defined by normal ovarian morphology.


SETTING
This was a clinic-based study.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Clinical, endocrine, and metabolic features in the various groups were compared, and estimates of broad-sense heritability were obtained using the quantitative transmission disequilibrium test.


RESULTS
Although affected sisters had fewer symptoms than probands (30% had no symptoms of PCOS), serum testosterone, androstenedione, LH, and fasting insulin and insulin sensitivity were similar in the two groups with polycystic ovaries but significantly different from those in unaffected sisters or controls. We observed moderate to high heritabilities for all traits studied in affected sister pairs, whereas heritabilities calculated from discordant siblings were substantially lower.


CONCLUSIONS
These data provide further evidence for a genetic basis of PCOS. The high heritability of biochemical features in probands and affected sisters, despite wide variation in symptoms, shows that not only are these biochemical traits strongly influenced by genetic factors but also, importantly, that polycystic ovarian morphology is an index of inherited traits in families with PCOS.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2008,58.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '2377813', 'name': 'S.

In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), one of the main features is chronic anovulation associated with lower pregnancy rates. Little is known regarding the psychological aspects associated with infertility in these patients. Therefore, we examined the influence of an unfulfilled wish to conceive on various aspects of psychological functioning in PCOS women.


METHODS
Standardized questionnaires assessing quality-of-life (36-item short-form health survey, SF-36), depressiveness (Beck Depression Inventory), emotional distress (Symptom Check List 90, SCL-90-R), sexual satisfaction and self-worth (visual analogue scales), and a questionnaire on the desire for a child (FKW) were administered at the outpatient endocrine clinic to consecutive PCOS patients.


RESULTS
Questionnaires from 115 PCOS patients were analysed. The majority (76.1%) worried about remaining childless in the future, and 51.3% reported a current wish to conceive. 23.9% of patients had scores indicating mild to moderate depression, and 25.2% had scores indicating clinically relevant depression. Furthermore, all quality-of-life scores were significantly lower compared with normative data (P < 0.001). Unexpectedly, comparisons of patients with a current unfulfilled desire to conceive to those with no present wish for a child revealed no discernable impact on depressive symptoms, quality-of-life or emotional distress. Reduced sexual satisfaction and self-worth were largely determined by partnership status and not infertility. However for PCOS patients who wished to conceive, the wish for a child was a significantly greater priority when compared with normative data from infertile patients.

The authors aimed to estimate prevalence and phenotype in a community setting in Sri Lanka and to test a valid, feasible screening approach to early diagnosis. A community-based, cross-sectional study was carried out in 2005-2006. A random sample of 3,030 women aged 15-39 years was selected by cluster sampling proportionate to population size. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was utilized to screen for ""probable cases"" of PCOS based on menstrual history and clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism. Selected ""probable cases"" underwent clinical, biochemical, and ovarian ultrasound assessment. The response rate was 96.2% (n = 2,915). A total of 220 (7.5%) ""probable cases"" were identified: 209 women with oligo/amenorrhea (95%) and 11 women with hirsutism (5%). Further evaluation of the 220 probable cases confirmed 164 newly diagnosed cases of PCOS based on the 2003 Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. With 19 previously diagnosed cases already present, total prevalence was 6.3% (95% confidence interval: 5.9, 6.8). Of the women with ""oligo/amenorrhea and/or hirsutism,"" 91.1% were confirmed to have PCOS; 99.4% of women with ""regular cycles in the absence of clinical hyperandrogenism"" were confirmed as normal. The most common phenotypes of PCOS were oligo/amenorrhea and polycystic ovaries (91.4%) and oligo/amenorrhea and hirsutism (48.3%).",American Journal of Epidemiology,2008,143.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '153443500', 'name': 'V.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a greater clustering of cardiac risk factors. However, the link between PCOS and cardiovascular (CV) disease is incompletely described.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the risk of CV events in 390 postmenopausal women enrolled in the National Institutes of Health-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NIH-NHLBI) sponsored Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study according to clinical features of PCOS.


METHODS
A total of 104 women had clinical features of PCOS defined by a premenopausal history of irregular menses and current biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenemia. Hyperandrogenemia was defined as the top quartile of androstenedione (> or = 701 pg/ml), testosterone (> or = 30.9 ng/dl), or free testosterone (> or = 4.5 pg/ml). Cox proportional hazard model was fit to estimate CV death or myocardial infarction (n = 55).


RESULTS
Women with clinical features of PCOS were more often diabetic (P < 0.0001), obese (P = 0.005), had the metabolic syndrome (P < 0.0001), and had more angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD) (P = 0.04) compared to women without clinical features of PCOS. Cumulative 5-yr CV event-free survival was 78.9% for women with clinical features of PCOS (n = 104) vs. 88.7% for women without clinical features of PCOS (n = 286) (P = 0.006). PCOS remained a significant predictor (P < 0.01) in prognostic models including diabetes, waist circumference, hypertension, and angiographic CAD as covariates.


CONCLUSION
Among postmenopausal women evaluated for suspected ischemia, clinical features of PCOS are associated with more angiographic CAD and worsening CV event-free survival. Identification of postmenopausal women with clinical features of PCOS may provide an opportunity for risk factor intervention for the prevention of CAD and CV events.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2008,459.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1995878', 'name': 'L.

Insulin sensitizers, including metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZDs), improve hyperinsulinemia and reproductive dysfunctions in some women with hyperandrogenism. The extent to which these agents improve hirsutism remains unclear.


OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials of metformin or TZDs for the treatment of hirsutism.


DATA SOURCES
We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL (up to May 2006). Review of reference lists and contact with hirsutism experts further identified candidate trials.


STUDY SELECTION
Reviewers working independently and in duplicate, with acceptable chance-adjusted agreement (kappa = 0.72), determined trial eligibility. Eligible trials randomly assigned women with hirsutism to at least 6 months of insulin sensitizers or control and measured hirsutism outcomes.


DATA EXTRACTION
Reviewers working independently and in duplicate determined the methodological quality of trials and collected data on patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes.


DATA SYNTHESIS
Of 348 candidate studies, 16 trials (22 comparisons) were eligible. The methodological quality of these trials was low. Random-effects metaanalyses showed a small decrease in Ferriman-Gallwey scores in women treated with insulin sensitizers compared with placebo [pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) of -1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), -2.8 to -0.2; inconsistency (I(2)) = 75%]. There was no significant difference between insulin sensitizers and oral contraceptives (WMD of -0.5; CI, -5.0, 3.9; I(2) = 79%). Metformin was inferior to both spironolactone (WMD of 1.3; CI, 0.03, 2.6) and flutamide (WMD of 5.0; CI, 3.0, 7.0; I(2) = 0%).

91,055738ba1f991604bd63787bfff0d4bae5782c43,Is there an independent effect of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and menopause on the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis in middle aged women?,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common reproductive endocrine condition manifests at puberty, and is characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and obesity. PCOS cases exhibit an adverse coronary heart disease (CHD) profile at an early age, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and increased central adiposity. It can be hypothesized that the menopausal transition, whether natural or surgical, may provide an additional “insult”, resulting in greater cumulative risk to their vasculature. Coronary artery calcification (CAC), a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis (SCA), was measured by electron beam tomography in 149 PCOS cases and 166 controls (mean age 47.3 and 49.4 respectively). Cases had a higher prevalence of CAC (63.1%) compared to controls (41.0%), (p = 0.037) after adjustment for age and BMI. A total of 22 cases and 39 controls had undergone natural menopause, 12 cases and 26 controls underwent surgical menopause (with biochemical confirmation) and 115 cases and 101 controls reported being currently premenopausal. There was a significant difference in CAC values between cases and controls in all three-menopause categories including pre-menopausal, surgically induced and natural menopause (p < 0.001). Duration since menopause (years) and use of hormone replacement therapy were not different between cases and controls for the two menopause groups. Logistic regression was carried out with CAC ( ≤10 vs >10) as the dependent variable, and independent variables: PCOS status, current age, BMI, and menopausal status, (pre-menopause, surgical and natural menopause) and selected CHD risk factors. The data indicate that women with PCOS exhibit significantly increased CAC compared to controls after adjustment for age and BMI and menopausal status. PCOS status and fasting glucose were significant risk factors for CAC (p < 0.05). Both natural and surgical menopause were independent risk factors for CAC as well (p < 0.01). HDLT was of borderline significance, p < 0.10. Further follow-up of this cohort will be valuable in determining whether PCOS status continues to affect cardiovascular risk as they undergo the menopausal transition.",Vascular Health and Risk Management,2008,52.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4840412', 'name': 'E.

Lifestyle modifications are successfully employed to treat obese and overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aims of the current pilot study were (i) to compare the efficacy on reproductive functions of a structured exercise training (SET) programme with a diet programme in obese PCOS patients and (ii) to study their clinical, hormonal and metabolic effects to elucidate potentially different mechanisms of action.


METHODS
Forty obese PCOS patients with anovulatory infertility underwent a SET programme (SET group, n = 20) and a hypocaloric hyperproteic diet (diet group, n = 20). Clinical, hormonal and metabolic data were assessed at baseline, and at 12- and 24-week follow-ups. Primary endpoint was cumulative pregnancy rate.


RESULTS
The two groups had similar demographic, anthropometric and biochemical parameters. After intervention, a significant improvement in menstrual cycles and fertility was noted in both groups, with no differences between groups. The frequency of menses and the ovulation rate were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the SET group than in diet group but the increased cumulative pregnancy rate was not significant. Body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, insulin resistance indexes and serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate changed significantly (P < 0.05) from baseline and were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the two groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Both SET and diet interventions improve fertility in obese PCOS patients with anovulatory infertility.

Obesity-related predisposition to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) could reflect overall adiposity and/or regional accumulation of abdominal visceral fat.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of the study was to compare distributions of visceral, abdominal sc, and gluteofemoral sc adipose tissue in PCOS cases vs. control women.


DESIGN
This was a cross-sectional study.


SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
Fat depot measurements from axial magnetic resonance imaging scans taken at anatomically predefined sites were compared between 22 body mass index (BMI)/fat mass-matched pairs of PCOS cases and controls; whole-group comparisons included 50 PCOS cases vs. 28 female controls. All subjects were of UK British/Irish origin.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
We measured cross-sectional areas of adipose tissue within visceral (mid-L4), abdominal (mid-L4) sc, and gluteofemoral (greater trochanteric and midfemoral) sc fat depots. Other measurements included fat mass, BMI, testosterone, SHBG, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (a measure of insulin sensitivity). Whole-group analyses were adjusted for fat mass and age.


RESULTS
There were no significant differences in fat-depot measurements between BMI/fat mass-matched pairs of PCOS cases and controls: mid-L4 visceral (P=0.40), abdominal sc (P=0.22), gluteal sc (P=0.67), and midfemoral sc (P=0.37) depots. Whole-group comparisons gave similar results after adjustments for fat mass and age. Fasting serum insulin concentrations (P=0.03) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (P=0.03) were significantly higher in the PCOS group than BMI/fat mass-matched controls.


CONCLUSIONS
PCOS cases and BMI/fat mass-matched control women are indistinguishable with respect to distribution of fat within visceral, abdominal sc, and gluteofemoral sc depots, despite significant differences in insulin resistance between these two groups.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2008,160.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '30653409', 'name': 'T.

There are no published data on this syndrome in Libyan patients. Aims and objectives To assess the frequency of clinical and biochemical features of PCOS in our patient population, and to compare this with data collected in other parts of the world. Subjects and methods A retrospective analysis of patient records at the endocrine clinic in Benghazi was undertaken. Patient inclusion was according to Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM criteria. Clinical features, associated diseases, family history, hormone levels, and ultrasonography results were analyzed. Results The mean age of the 318 PCOS patients at presentation was 25.8 years (range 15–44 years), and the majority (67%) were 20–29 years old at presentation. Of all patients, 57% were obese (BMI≥30), 93% had oligo-/amenorrhea, 91% were hirsute, and 74% had ultrasound features of polycystic ovaries. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 9% of all PCOS patients and hypertension in 4%. Total serum testosterone was elevated in 26% of the patients, and serum prolactin was elevated in 31%. Thyroid disease was noted among 5.3% of the patients, and a history of diabetes or hypertension among first-degree relatives was seen in (16%) and (8%) of the patients respectively.

98,3f09418952d987e2035afd4bb224da2cfe5aea45,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Oocyte Developmental Competence,"Folliculogenesis is a complex process, in which multiple endocrine and intraovarian paracrine interactions create a changing intrafollicular microenvironment for appropriate oocyte development. Within this microenvironment, bidirectional cumulus cell-oocyte signaling governs the gradual acquisition of developmental competence by the oocyte, defined as the ability of the oocyte to complete meiosis and undergo fertilization, embryogenesis, and term development. These regulatory mechanisms of follicle growth, controlled in part by the oocyte itself, are susceptible to derangement in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by ovarian hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and paracrine dysregulation of follicle development. Consequently, only a subset of PCOS patients experience reduced pregnancy outcome after ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization. Recent data implicate functional associations between endocrine/paracrine abnormalities, metabolic dysfunction, and altered oocyte gene expression with impaired oocyte developmental competence in women with PCOS. Therefore, an understanding of how developmentally relevant endocrine/paracrine factors interact to promote optimal oocyte developmental is crucial to identify those PCOS patients who might benefit from long-term correction of follicle growth to improve fertility, optimize follicular responsiveness to gonadotropin therapy, and enhance pregnancy outcome by in vitro fertilization. Editor’s Note: Dr. Dumesic, the first author of the insightful and informative overview of the molecular and pathologic abnormalities underpinning the varying degrees of severity of polycystic ovary syndrome, presented a lecture on this topic at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Toronto in June, 2007.

99,89d5f9a0940191c87bf4e22747650dd409930c8f,Management of polycystic ovary syndrome in postmenopausal women: a medical black hole,"Our understanding of the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has continued to grow over the last 10–15 years. For a condition first described in 1935 and affecting 5–10% of the female population, it has been a slow path to enlightenment. Three potential etiologies have been proposed: hypothalamic–pituitary axis abnormalities, insulin resistance and an enzymatic defect of ovarian and/ or adrenal steroidogenesis. Several candidate genes have been associated with PCOS and it is likely that environmental influences modulate the severity of the condition. Furthermore, the phenotypic expression of PCOS changes as women age. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS remain controversial. The protocol agreed by the consensus conference in Rotterdam in 2003 has been criticised as being overly inclusive. It is likely that some new consensus will be required. However, the diagnosis currently requires exclusion of other endocrine abnormalities and then satisfaction of two of the three remaining criteria: chronic anovulation, positive ultrasound scan appearance and biochemical/clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism. We have become more proactive in managing PCOS in women of reproductive age – although this is highly variable between physicians and between institutions. We recognize that it may present with premature onset of puberty or early difficulties with weight management and that it should be sought when a woman presents with hirsutism or oligomenorrhea. We combine lifestyle intervention with medical therapies, including the oral contraceptive pill, antiandrogen agents or metformin. We institute ovulation induction therapy in those anovulatory women. But how often do we make basic mistakes in the diagnostic process, for instance, measuring hormone levels or requesting an ultrasound scan when the woman is taking the oral contraceptive pill? And then dismissing the diagnosis when these results are normal. And how often do we think of PCOS in women with isolated adult acne? Over one-third of women presenting to a dermatology clinic with isolated acne were shown to have PCOS. Other series have shown that over 80% of women with adult acne have polycystic-appearing ovaries and nearly 90% will have at least one elevated androgen level. Our experience is that years of dermatological therapy have typically been undertaken before hormone assays or a scan are requested. Repeated relapses in acne following retinoid treatment are distressing for the patient but often act as a surrogate diagnostic test for an underlying androgen disorder. And do we just forget all about PCOS after menopause? Not uncommonly, women are told that the problem will go away, leading to loss of medical contact with women entering an age group at high risk for metabolic complications. Androgen levels decrease as women approach their mid-years but studies have suggested that testosterone levels are still higher among postmenopausal women with polycystic-appearing ovaries, compared to women with normal ovarian morphology. In our clinical practice, it is not unusual to make a diagnosis of PCOS as women approach menopause when they present with increasing acne or worsening of their long-standing, but previously mild, hirsutism. There is a clearly established association between PCOS and the metabolic syndrome. CLIMACTERIC 2008;11:89–90",Climacteric,2008,4.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '119858385', 'name': 'A.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have been reported to have subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and increased abdominal fat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between visceral fat (VF) and early markers of CVD in PCOS women.


METHODS
Two hundred overweight PCOS women [(mean +/- SD) age 24.6 +/- 3.2 years, body mass index (BMI) 28.5 +/- 2.8 kg/m2] and 100 healthy age- and BMI-matched volunteer controls entered this cross-sectional study. In all subjects, the amount of VF was measured by ultrasonography. Anthropometric measurements [BMI and waist circumference (WC)], complete hormonal and metabolic pattern, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), brachial arterial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and inflammatory biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, white blood cells count and plasminogen activated inhibitor-1] were also obtained from all subjects. A stepwise linear regression model was used in PCOS patients to verify if IMT or FMD as dependent variables are affected by other independent variables.


RESULTS
VF amount was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in PCOS subjects than in healthy controls [31.4 +/- 7.3 versus 28.0 +/- 6.1 (mean+/-SD) mm, respectively] and directly related to insulin resistance: HOMA (r = 0.918, P < 0.001) and AUC(INS) (r = 0.879, P < 0.001), and to WC (r = 0.658; P < 0.001). In PCOS, the two linear regression analyses showed that IMT is positively affected by VF and CRP, whereas FMD is positively affected by IMT and negatively by VF and CRP.

We systematically searched the literature to identify the impact of symptoms and treatments for PCOS on health-related QoL (HRQoL) and to report on the types and psychometric properties of the instruments used. Papers were retrieved by systematically searching four electronic databases and hand searching relevant reference lists and bibliographies. Nineteen papers used a standardized questionnaire to measure health status; of these 12 (63.2%) used generic tools and 8 (42%) used the disease-specific PCOS questionnaire. Although a meta-analysis was not possible, it appears that weight concerns have a particular negative impact upon HRQoL, although the role of body mass index in affecting HRQoL scores is inconclusive from the available evidence. Acne is the area least reported upon in terms of its impact upon HRQoL. With the exception of three studies, most of the research has focused upon adult women with PCOS.

Earlier epidemiologic studies with second- and third-generation OCPs in the general population have raised important questions regarding long-term cardiometabolic effects of these agents. In PCOS, there are only a few short-term studies with contradictory results evaluating potential adverse effects of OCPs on cardiovascular risk factors and glucose homeostasis. These studies included a small number of participants and did not take into account several confounding factors that might influence the outcome. Nevertheless, limited available data support the benefits of long-term OCP use in PCOS. By contrast, solid evidence for cardiometabolic adverse outcome with the use of these agents, especially with newer OCPs containing antiandrogenic progestins, is lacking. More studies are needed to resolve controversies regarding the safety of long-term OCP use in PCOS.

Hirsutism among women of fertile age is commonly seen in clinical practice, but the pattern of the disease in Saudi Arabs has not been studied. The aim of the study was to determine the clinical, biochemical and etiologic features of hirsutism in Saudi females.


METHODS
101 Saudi Arab women presenting with hirsutism at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2005 were prospectively assessed using the recently approved diagnostic guidelines for hyperandrogenic women with hirsutism.


RESULTS
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was the cause of hirsutism in 83 patients (82%) followed by idiopathic hirsutism (IH) in 11 patients (11%). Others causes of hirsutism included late onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia in 4 patients (4%), microprolactinoma in 2 (2%) and Cushingâs syndrome in 1 (1%) patient. Age at presentation of PCOS was 24.5+/-6.6 years (mean+/-SD) and 51% of the subjects were obese. Furthermore, 74 (89%) of patients with PCOS had an oligo/anovulatory cycle while the remaining 9 patients (11%) maintained normal regular menstrual cycle. Luteinizing hormone and total testosterone were significantly higher in patients with PCOS than in those with IH (P<.05).

SummaryBody weight and specific dietary factors may affect fertility but evidence regarding dietary effects on fertility treatment outcomes is lacking. Research suggests that diets with a low glycemic load during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes or large-for-gestational-age births after adjusting for body mass index and total energy intake, but the effect of protein modification remains controversial. There is also lack of information on the impact of energy restriction during pregnancy on maternal and infant outcomes.

We evaluated carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) as an early marker of atherosclerosis, as well as its main determinants among androgen excess, obesity and insulin resistance, in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).


METHODS
We selected 40 PCOS patients and 20 non-hyperandrogenic women who were similar in terms of age and grade of obesity. Complete clinical, metabolic and hormonal profiles and left common CIMT measurements were obtained.


RESULTS
Patients with PCOS presented with increased mean CIMT values when compared with controls (F = 8.575; P = 0.005), and this was independent of obesity. Five PCOS patients but no controls had increased CIMT values. CIMT correlated directly with serum total and free testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate levels and mean 24-h heart rate (HR), and inversely with the insulin sensitivity index (ISI), but no correlation was observed with the body mass index (BMI). Multiple stepwise linear regression models showed that in PCOS patients, the main determinants of CIMT were serum total testosterone or androstenedione concentrations, with no influence of ISI or the mean 24-h HR.

In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is associated with abnormalities in insulin signaling, fatty acid metabolism, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In PCOS patients, the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance are, however, less well characterized. To identify biological pathways of importance for the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in PCOS, we compared gene expression in skeletal muscle of metabolically characterized PCOS patients (n = 16) and healthy control subjects (n = 13) using two different approaches for global pathway analysis: gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA 1.0) and gene map annotator and pathway profiler (GenMAPP 2.0). We demonstrate that impaired insulin-stimulated total, oxidative and nonoxidative glucose disposal in PCOS patients are associated with a consistent downregulation of OXPHOS gene expression using GSEA and GenMAPP analysis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis validated these findings and showed that reduced levels of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator α (PGC-1α) could play a role in the downregulation of OXPHOS genes in PCOS. In these women with PCOS, the decrease in OXPHOS gene expression in skeletal muscle cannot be ascribed to obesity and diabetes. This supports the hypothesis of an early association between insulin resistance and impaired mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, which is, in part, mediated by reduced PGC-1α levels.

Insulin resistance and obesity are common features of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), a new fat-derived adipokine, has been described to be elevated in obesity and type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether serum RBP4 levels are correlated with metabolic parameters, indices of insulin resistance, and endocrine variables in German PCOS women.


DESIGN
We assessed the correlation between metabolic and endocrine parameters with RBP4 levels in 200 PCOS patients and 64 healthy controls.


METHODS
Serum RBP4 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immundiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany). In addition, anthropometric variables, clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, and body fat were evaluated, and a glucose tolerance test was performed to assess parameters of insulin resistance and glucose metabolism.


RESULTS
Taking the entire PCOS cohort, RBP4 levels were positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), body fat, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and area under the curve for glucose (all P<0.05), but not with indices of insulin resistance. On the other hand, PCOS women with impaired glucose metabolism had higher RBP4 levels than PCOS women with normal glucose metabolism (median 30.6, range 23.3-73.9 versus median 26.3, range 6.4-61.4, P<0.05). Furthermore, no differences were found in RBP4 levels between lean PCOS women and BMI-matched healthy controls.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with poor quality of life (QoL) and high levels of depression. Existing research is confounded by small sample sizes and inconsistent use of control groups.


METHODS
Depression and QoL were assessed in women with PCOS and healthy controls (n = 1359). The polycystic ovary syndrome health-related QoL questionnaire (PCOSQ) was modified to include an acne subscale.


RESULTS
Seventy-one percentage of women with PCOS who were taking anti-androgen (AA) medication and 67% not taking AA medication were classified as depressed. Women with PCOS had lower QoL on all seven factors of the modified PCOSQ (emotional disturbance, weight, infertility, acne, menstrual symptoms, menstrual predictability and hirsutism). Weight was the largest contributor to poor QoL for women taking and not taking AA medication. Women taking AA medications, independent of diagnosis, generally had better QoL than women not taking them.

Increased abdominal fat has been linked to insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk. Because many patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) present abdominal obesity, it may be the cause of insulin resistance in this disorder.


SETTING
Fat quantity and distribution were evaluated by dual x-ray absorptiometry at the Departments of Clinical Medicine at the University of Palermo and the University of Naples, Italy.


PATIENTS
A total of 110 patients with PCOS and 112 weight-matched controls were studied. Anthropometric data, blood glucose, serum insulin, and testosterone were evaluated. Total, trunk, and central abdominal fat quantity were measured by total-body dual x-ray absorptiometry.


RESULTS
Compared with weight-matched controls, patients with PCOS had similar quantity of total and trunk fat but higher quantity of central abdominal fat. This difference was not observed when comparing obese PCOS and obese controls but depended on differences between overweight and normoweight patients and controls. All obese subjects, independently of having PCOS or not, had increased central abdominal fat. The same parameter was increased in 71% of overweight PCOS, 50% of overweight controls, and 30% of normoweight PCOS patients. PCOS patients with increased central abdominal fat had significantly higher (P < 0.01) insulin levels and significantly reduced (P < 0.01) insulin sensitivity than controls with similar quantities of central abdominal fat. Overweight PCOS patients with normal abdominal fat had significantly higher (P < 0.05) insulin levels and significantly reduced (P < 0.05) insulin sensitivity than overweight controls with normal abdominal fat.

Methods: Women with PCOS were given the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Sexual Distress Scale, the Sexual Energy Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, a Perceived Body Image Questionnaire, and a bioT and totT blood test. Two-tailed Pearson correlations were made between sexual function, body mass index, depression, and T levels. Results: Thirty-three women (mean age 36) completed the questionnaires, and 23 underwent bioT and totT levels. Twenty-one of 33 (64%) women reported sexually related personal distress, and 20/33 (61%) reported some degree of depression. Sexual distress and depression were each associated with lack of sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, and orgasm (P Conclusions: Our study population of women with PCOS demonstrated a high level of sexual dysfunction. All of these women were clinically obese, and negative body image was found to correlate with sexual dysfunction. The majority experienced psychologic depression, which also correlated with the degree of sexual dysfunction.

The object of this review was to compare metformin versus oral contraceptive pill (OCP) treatment in polycystic ovary syndrome.


METHODS
A systematic review and meta-analysis employing the principles of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group was undertaken.


RESULTS
Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (104 subjects) were included. Limited data demonstrated no evidence of a difference in effect between metformin and the OCP on hirsutism, acne or development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. There were no trials assessing diagnosis of cardiovascular disease or endometrial cancer. Metformin, in comparison with the OCP, was less effective in improving menstrual pattern [Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.45) and in reducing the serum total testosterone level weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.54, 95% CI 0.22-0.86] but more effective in reducing fasting insulin (WMD -3.46, 95% CI - 5.39 to -1.52) and not increasing fasting triglyceride (WMD -0.48, 95% CI - 0.86 to -0.09) levels. Limited data demonstrated no evidence of a difference in effect between the two therapies on reducing fasting glucose or total cholesterol levels and severe adverse events.

121,44fa67b6f6a3e6ecf84c0033bdf08b49130ba498,Polycystic ovary syndrome: early detection in the adolescent.,"The primary clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are hirsutism and irregular menstrual bleeding due to ovarian androgen excess and chronic anovulation. Historically, these features emerge late in puberty or shortly thereafter. The presence of insulin resistance or obesity, both commonly associated with this disorder, seems to further amplify the severity of the presentation. Perhaps, the most important finding is that of progressive hirsutism. Irregular menstrual bleeding is less reliable unless the duration of menstrual irregularity is persistent. However, mild hair growth and chronic anovulation are also regarded as normal components of the late stages of puberty and early adolescence and may persist for several years. It is for this reason that the diagnosis is often not made until later in life when endocrine and metabolic dysfunctions have been firmly established. The evolution of PCOS during early adolescence is not well-understood, but seems to involve abnormal activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian-adrenal axis accompanied by specific morphologic changes of the ovary. Efforts to minimize the clinical features of PCOS in young adolescent girls depend on early diagnosis and timely suppression of excess ovarian androgen production.",Clinical obstetrics and gynecology,2007,55.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '15472178', 'name': 'R.

Design: Cross-sectional study of community-dwelling non-estrogen-using postmenopausal-white women (N = 713; mean ± SD age, 73.8 ± 7.9 years; mean body mass index, 24.0 ± 3.5 kg/m2) participating in the Rancho Bernardo Study. A putative PCOS phenotype was defined as the presence of three or more of the following features: (1) recalled history of irregular menses, (2) symptomatic premenopausal hyperandrogenism or biochemical evidence of current biochemical hyperandrogenism, (3) history of infertility or miscarriage, (4) central obesity, or (5) insulin resistance. Atherosclerotic CVD was determined from clinical history, electrocardiography, and structured interviews using validated techniques. The analysis was stratified by diabetes status, ascertained from medical history or 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests. Results: The PCOS phenotype was present in 9.3% of the entire cohort and 5.8% of nondiabetic women. The prevalence of CVD was similar between women with the phenotype and unaffected women (27.3% vs 24.4%).

The polycystic ovary syndrome is a common cause of infertility. Clomiphene and insulin sensitizers are used alone and in combination to induce ovulation, but it is unknown whether one approach is superior.


METHODS
We randomly assigned 626 infertile women with the polycystic ovary syndrome to receive clomiphene citrate plus placebo, extended-release metformin plus placebo, or a combination of metformin and clomiphene for up to 6 months. Medication was discontinued when pregnancy was confirmed, and subjects were followed until delivery.


RESULTS
The live-birth rate was 22.5% (47 of 209 subjects) in the clomiphene group, 7.2% (15 of 208) in the metformin group, and 26.8% (56 of 209) in the combination-therapy group (P<0.001 for metformin vs. both clomiphene and combination therapy; P=0.31 for clomiphene vs. combination therapy). Among pregnancies, the rate of multiple pregnancy was 6.0% in the clomiphene group, 0% in the metformin group, and 3.1% in the combination-therapy group. The rates of first-trimester pregnancy loss did not differ significantly among the groups. However, the conception rate among subjects who ovulated was significantly lower in the metformin group (21.7%) than in either the clomiphene group (39.5%, P=0.002) or the combination-therapy group (46.0%, P<0.001). With the exception of pregnancy complications, adverse-event rates were similar in all groups, though gastrointestinal side effects were more frequent, and vasomotor and ovulatory symptoms less frequent, in the metformin group than in the clomiphene group.


CONCLUSIONS
Clomiphene is superior to metformin in achieving live birth in infertile women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, although multiple birth is a complication.

Hyperandrogenism is included as a referential but not as an essential factor in the diagnostic criteria of the Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG 1993). However, some patients with the typical clinical features of PCOS are not diagnosed with PCOS using JSOG 1993 criteria because they do not have a high LH level, which is defined as essential for diagnosis. In this study, we compared total testosterone (T) levels between Japanese patients with PCOS diagnosed using the JSOG 1993 criteria and normal menstrual women (controls). Fifty controls and 46 patients with PCOS were enrolled in this study. Furthermore, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off value of T. The mean T level of patients with PCOS was significantly higher than that of the control (86 +/- 48 vs 68 +/- 46, P<0.01), and the prevalence rates of hyperandrogenism (T >114 ng/dL; defined as the mean +2SD of the control) were 10.2% in patients with PCOS and 4% in controls. The area under the ROC curve of T was 0.72, and there was no decision threshold to diagnose PCOS by T alone with both high sensitivity and high specificity. If the threshold is set as 110 ng/dL in order to gain high specificity, 94% of women whose serum level passed the threshold will be patients with PCOS. Although T should not be used as an independent essential factor of Japanese PCOS, it might be useful as a complementary factor in order to diagnose patients who have typical clinical features of PCOS but does not fulfill the JSOG 1993 criteria for PCOS.",Endocrine journal,2007,18.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '47382852', 'name': 'T.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, is characterized by increased ovarian androgen production and arrested follicle development and is frequently associated with insulin resistance. These PCOS phenotypes are associated with exaggerated ovarian responsiveness to FSH and increased pregnancy loss.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to examine whether the perturbations in follicle growth and the intrafollicular environment affect gene expression and ultimately development of the PCOS oocyte.


DESIGN
Oocyte cDNA was subjected to microarray and PCR analysis.


SETTING
This study was conducted at a university laboratory.


PATIENTS
The study comprised 10 normal ovulatory women and nine women with PCOS.


INTERVENTION
The intervention was GnRH analog/recombinant human FSH therapy for in vitro fertilization.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
The main outcome measure was mRNA abundance of oocyte-expressed genes.


RESULTS
Cluster analysis revealed differences in global gene expression profiles between normal and PCOS oocytes. Of the 8123 transcripts expressed in the oocytes, 374 genes showed significant differences in mRNA abundance in PCOS oocytes. Annotation of the data demonstrated that a subset of these genes was associated with chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis and/or meiosis. Furthermore, 68 of the differentially expressed genes contained putative androgen receptor and/or peroxisome proliferating receptor gamma binding sites.


CONCLUSIONS
These analyses demonstrated that normal and PCOS oocytes that are morphologically indistinguishable and of high quality exhibit different gene expression profiles. Promoter analysis suggests that androgens and other activators of nuclear receptors may play a role in differential gene expression in the PCOS oocyte. Likewise, annotation of the differentially expressed genes suggests that defects in meiosis or early embryonic development may contribute to reduced developmental competency of PCOS oocytes.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2007,222.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '48463248', 'name': 'J.

An altered lipid profile is common in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and is usually characterized by increased triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. In the general population, these alterations are often associated with the increase of small low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) in the so-called ""atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype"" (ALP) that determines a further increase of cardiovascular risk. In this study, we evaluated the presence of ALP in the plasma of women with PCOS.


SETTING
Measurements and analysis of LDL size were performed at the Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Clinical Nutrition, University Hospital, Zurich. PCOS patients were recruited at the Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Palermo, and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Pisa.


PATIENTS
Thirty patients with PCOS (hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation) and 24 matched controls were studied. Anthropometric data, blood glucose, serum insulin lipid profile, and LDL size and subclasses were evaluated.


RESULTS
Compared with controls, patients with PCOS had higher plasma concentrations of insulin and triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations but no differences in LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol. Patients with PCOS had smaller LDL size due to a reduction in LDL subclass I, with a concomitant increase in LDL subclasses III and IV. Fourteen PCOS patients had an increase of smaller LDL particles, and it represented the second most common lipid alteration after decrease in HDL-cholesterol. However, because in this PCOS population hypertriglyceridemia was only present in two patients, complete ALP was relatively uncommon.


CONCLUSIONS
Increase of type III or type IV LDL subclasses is a common finding in PCOS and represents the second most common lipid alteration after HDL-cholesterol decrease.

The Rotterdam criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) defines discrete subgroups whose phenotypes are not yet clear.


OBJECTIVE
The phenotypic characteristics of women in the PCOS subgroups defined by the Rotterdam criteria were compared.


DESIGN
The study was observational.


SETTING
Subjects were studied in an outpatient setting in Boston and Reykjavik.


PATIENTS
Four subgroups of subjects with PCOS defined by 1) irregular menses (IM), hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM, n = 298); 2) IM/HA (n = 7); 3) HA/PCOM (n = 77); and 4) IM/PCOM (n = 36) and a group of controls (n = 64), aged 18-45 yr, were examined.


INTERVENTION
Subjects underwent a physical exam; fasting blood samples for androgens, gonadotropins, and metabolic parameters; and a transvaginal ultrasound.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The phenotype was compared between groups.


RESULTS
Ninety-seven percent of women with IM/HA had PCOM. Therefore, the groups with and without PCOM were combined. The Ferriman-Gallwey score and androgen levels were highest in the hyperandrogenic groups (IM/HA and HA/PCOM), whereas ovarian volume was higher in all PCOS subgroups compared with controls, as expected based on the definitions of the PCOS subgroups. Body mass index and insulin levels were highest in the IM/HA subgroup.


CONCLUSIONS
Subjects with PCOS defined by IM/HA are the most severely affected women on the basis of androgen levels, ovarian volumes, and insulin levels.

The phenotype of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is variable, depending on the ethnic background.


OBJECTIVE
The phenotypes of women with PCOS in Iceland and Boston were compared.


DESIGN
The study was observational with a parallel design.


SETTING
Subjects were studied in an outpatient setting.


PATIENTS
Women, aged 18-45 yr, with PCOS defined by hyperandrogenism and fewer than nine menses per year, were examined in Iceland (n = 105) and Boston (n = 262).


INTERVENTION
PCOS subjects underwent a physical exam, fasting blood samples for androgens, gonadotropins, metabolic parameters, and a transvaginal ultrasound.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The phenotype of women with PCOS was compared between Caucasian women in Iceland and Boston and among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian women in Boston.


RESULTS
Androstenedione (4.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.2 ng/ml; P < 0.01) was higher and testosterone (54.0 +/- 25.7 vs. 66.2 +/- 35.6 ng/dl; P < 0.01), LH (23.1 +/- 15.8 vs. 27.6 +/- 16.2 IU/liter; P < 0.05), and Ferriman Gallwey score were lower (7.1 +/- 6.0 vs. 15.4 +/- 8.5; P < 0.001) in Caucasian Icelandic compared with Boston women with PCOS. There were no differences in fasting blood glucose, insulin, or homeostasis model assessment in body mass index-matched Caucasian subjects from Iceland or Boston or in different ethnic groups in Boston. Polycystic ovary morphology was demonstrated in 93-100% of women with PCOS in all ethnic groups.


CONCLUSIONS
The data demonstrate differences in the reproductive features of PCOS without differences in glucose and insulin in body mass index-matched populations. These studies also suggest that measuring androstenedione is important for the documentation of hyperandrogenism in Icelandic women. Finally, polycystic ovary morphology by ultrasound is an almost universal finding in women with PCOS as defined by hyperandrogenism and irregular menses.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2006,97.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4896916', 'name': 'C.

This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the risk of pregnancy and neonatal complications in women with PCOS. Electronic databases were searched for the following MeSH headings: PCOS, hyperandrogenism, pregnancy outcome, pregnancy complications, diabetes mellitus, type II. A handsearch of human reproduction and fertility and sterility was also conducted. Studies in which pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS were compared with controls were considered for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Fifteen of 525 identified studies were included, involving 720 women presenting with PCOS and 4505 controls.

The few controlled trials performed so far indicate that the addition of metformin and/or flutamide to a hypocaloric diet in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) effectively influences different phenotypic aspects of the syndrome. All these studies are, however, characterized by a short to medium period of treatment.


OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to investigate the long-term effects of these therapies.


DESIGN AND SETTING
We conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial at a medical center.


PATIENTS
Of 80 overweight-obese women with PCOS, 76 completed the study.


INTERVENTIONS
Patients were placed on a hypocaloric diet for the first month and then on a hypocaloric diet plus placebo, metformin (850 mg, orally, twice a day), flutamide (250 mg, orally, twice a day), or metformin plus flutamide for the subsequent 12 months (20 subjects in each group).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We assessed clinical features, computerized tomography measurement of fat distribution, androgens, lipids, and fasting and glucose-stimulated glucose and insulin levels at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of treatment.


RESULTS
After 6 months, compared with placebo, flutamide further decreased visceral/sc fat mass (P = 0.044), androstenedione (P < 0.001), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < 0.001), and hirsutism score (P < 0.001), whereas metformin further increased frequency of menstruation (P = 0.039). After 12 months, flutamide maintained the effects observed after 6 months on visceral/sc fat mass (P = 0.033) and androstenedione (P < 0.001), whereas it produced an additional decrease in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P = 0.020) and hirsutism score (P = 0.019); metformin further improved the menstrual pattern (P = 0.013). Moreover, after 12 months, flutamide improved more than placebo the menstrual pattern (P = 0.008), glucose-stimulated glucose levels (P = 0.041), insulin sensitivity (P < 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = 0.003), whereas metformin decreased glucose-stimulated insulin levels (P = 0.014). The combination of the two drugs maintained the specific effect of each of the compounds, without any additive or synergistic effect.

The relevance of adult polycystic ovary criteria to adolescence is unclear.


OBJECTIVE
The objective was to determine the functional significance of polycystic-size ovaries (PSO) in healthy adolescents. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/INTERVENTIONS: Healthy 11- to 18-yr-old postmenarcheal volunteers (n = 22) were recruited and divided into groups with normal size ovaries (VNSO; n = 10) or a polycystic-size ovary (VPSO; n = 12). They were secondarily compared with adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; n = 8) matched for gynecological age and a PSO. All underwent GnRH agonist (GnRHag), oral glucose tolerance, and ACTH1-24 testing in our General Clinical Research Center.


RESULTS
VPSO had a higher peak 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17PROG) response to GnRHag than VNSO (146 +/- 14 ng/dl, mean +/- sem, vs. 85 +/- 11; P = 0.008), as well as larger ovaries (13.3 +/- 0.7 cc vs. 8.5 +/- 0.8 cc). VPSO peak 17PROG was elevated (>137 ng/dl) in 42% (5 of 12). However, VPSO and VNSO androgen levels were similar, with the exception of one VPSO subject who had hyperandrogenemia and thus met criteria for PCOS. VPSO were similar to VNSO in LH, FSH, estradiol, and adrenal androgenic function. Although the VPSO group resembled the PCOS group in their 17PROG response to the GnRHag test, they differed in having significantly smaller ovaries and lower body mass index and in lacking evidence of peripheral androgen excess and of insulin resistance.


CONCLUSION
A PSO in asymptomatic adolescents seems typically to be a normal variant.

141,54ff5efd175a22b5b0fab7b57fd42a0057b861b9,Oligoanovulation with polycystic ovaries but not overt hyperandrogenism.,"OBJECTIVES
By requiring a minimum of two of three items [hyperandrogenism (HA), oligoanovulation (OA), and polycystic ovaries (PCO) at ultrasound], the Rotterdam definition recognizes four PCO syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes: HA+OA+PCO (full-blown syndrome), HA+OA (former National Institutes of Health definition), HA+PCO (ovulatory PCOS), and OA+PCO. However, the latter phenotype is controversial, and it is not known to what extent it shares similarities with the others.


DESIGN
The study was a comparative analysis of hormonal, metabolic, and ultrasound parameters obtained from patients and controls that were consecutively included in a database.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Sixty-six patients having OA+PCO without hirsutism or elevated serum androstenedione and testosterone levels were compared with 118 normally cycling nonhyperandrogenic age-matched women without PCO (controls). These patients (phenotype D) were also compared with patients with HA+OA+PCO (phenotype A, n = 246), HA+OA (phenotype B, n = 27), and HA+PCO (phenotype C, n = 67).


RESULTS
Patients with phenotype D had higher mean values of waist circumference and higher mean levels of serum testosterone, androstenedione, and LH than controls. Conversely, they had lower mean serum levels of FSH and SHBG (P < 0.05 for each parameter). Variance analysis disclosed significant group effects between the different patients' phenotypes for all parameters, except age, BMI, and FSH. After multiple comparisons with post hoc analysis, phenotype D had milder endocrine and metabolic abnormalities than phenotype A, although it did not differ from phenotype C, except for androgen data, by definition. Phenotypes A and B were statistically similar, except for the ultrasound data, by definition.

PCOS is the most common endocrine disturbance to affect women of reproductive years. Although patients affected are often very disturbed by the cutaneous manifestations, including acne, hirsutism, alopecia, obesity, and acanthosis nigricans, the clinical manifestations of PCOS ramify far beyond the skin. PCOS frequently causes menstrual abnormalities and infertility. Insulin resistance is both pathogenic and a cause of numerous serious health consequences. The accurate diagnosis and recognition of cutaneous hyperandrogenism in PCOS are discussed. The differential diagnosis is reviewed. The work‐up and approach to evaluation of patients with PCOS is presented.

The cause of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is unknown, although genetic and environmental influences are clearly implicated. Some genetic studies have suggested the involvement of X-linked genes in PCOS, but the influence of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) on manifestation of this disorder has not previously been examined.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of the study was to test the null hypothesis that XCI has no influence on clinical presentation of PCOS.


DESIGN
We examined patterns of XCI between sister pairs with the same genotype at a polymorphic locus on the X chromosome in families with PCOS.


SETTING
The study was conducted at a private practice.


PARTICIPANTS
PCOS was defined as hyperandrogenemia with chronic anovulation. Forty families were studied in which DNA was obtained from at least one parent, the proband, and one sister that could be accurately diagnosed as being affected or unaffected.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
Relative expression of two X-linked alleles was determined, and the ratio of one to the other represented the pattern of XCI.


RESULTS
The statistical odds on a different clinical presentation between sisters was approximately 29 times higher in sister pairs with different patterns of XCI, compared with sister pairs with the same pattern of XCI (odds ratio 28.9; 95% confidence interval 4.0-206; P = 0.0008).


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence to refute the null hypothesis and propose a closer inspection of X-linked genes in PCOS, one in which both genotype and epigenotype are considered. Environmental determinants of PCOS may alter clinical presentation via epigenetic modifications, which currently remain undetected in traditional genetic analyses.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2006,65.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '37387166', 'name': 'T.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with menstrual and reproductive abnormalities, insulin resistance, and obesity.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of diagnosed PCOS and its association with cardiovascular risk factors.


SETTING
The study is set in an integrated health care delivery system in northern California.


PATIENTS
A total of 11,035 women with PCOS were identified by one or more outpatient diagnoses of PCOS using health plan databases. An age-matched sample of women without PCOS was also selected.


OUTCOME MEASURES
Prevalence of PCOS and targeted cardiovascular risk factors [hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and body mass index (BMI)] were measured.


RESULTS
During 2002-2004, the prevalence of diagnosed PCOS among female members aged 25-34 yr was 2.6% (95% confidence interval 1.6-1.7%). Women with diagnosed PCOS were more likely than those without PCOS to be obese [BMI > or = 30 mg/m(2); odds ratio (OR) 4.21, 3.96-4.47]. Furthermore, PCOS was associated with diabetes (OR 2.45, confidence interval 2.16-2.79), hypertension (OR 1.41, 1.31-1.51) and known dyslipidemia (OR 1.53, 1.39-1.68), even after adjusting for BMI and known confounders. Among women with PCOS, compared with whites, Blacks and Hispanics were more likely and Asians less likely to be obese; Asians and Hispanics were more likely to have diabetes; and Blacks were more likely and Hispanics less likely to have hypertension.


CONCLUSIONS
Within a large, community-based population receiving health care, diagnosed PCOS was highly prevalent and associated with a much higher frequency of cardiovascular risk factors that varied by race/ethnicity. Our prevalence estimates likely underestimate the true prevalence of PCOS. Further studies are needed to explore racial/ethnic differences and the extent to which PCOS contributes to future cardiovascular risk.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2006,364.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4549496', 'name': 'J.

Adult women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MBS). The prevalence of MBS is also increasing in adolescents.


OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to test the hypothesis that the prevalence of MBS is increased in adolescent girls with PCOS compared with the general population and to determine the factors associated with an increased risk of the MBS in PCOS.


DESIGN AND SETTING
We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study at academic medical centers with general clinical research centers.


PARTICIPANTS
Participants included 49 adolescent girls with PCOS and 165 girls from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) adolescent population of similar age and ethnic background.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
We assessed the prevalence of MBS according to currently proposed adolescent MBS criteria.


RESULTS
Thirty-seven percent of adolescent girls with PCOS had MBS compared with 5% of NHANES III girls (P < 0.0001). None of the girls of normal body mass index (BMI) had MBS, whereas 11% of overweight and 63% of obese girls with PCOS had MBS compared with 0 and 32% of NHANES III girls, respectively. Girls with PCOS were 4.5 times more likely to have MBS than age-matched NHANES III girls after adjusting for BMI (odds ratio, 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-17.7; P = 0.03). The odds of having the MBS were 3.8 times higher for every quartile increase in bioavailable testosterone in girls with PCOS after adjusting for BMI and insulin resistance (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-10.2; P = 0.008).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the metabolic syndrome have many features in common and may share the same pathogenesis.


OBJECTIVE
This study was performed to determine the prevalence and predictors of the metabolic syndrome in PCOS.


DESIGN
The clinical, hormonal, and oral glucose tolerance test results were analyzed in 394 PCOS women who were screened for participation in a multicenter trial to evaluate the effects of troglitazone on ovulation and hirsutism.


SETTING
A multicenter clinical trial is presented.


PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS
The subjects were women with PCOS who had or lacked the metabolic syndrome.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Waist circumference, fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, and blood pressure were the main outcome measures.


RESULTS
Twenty-six (6.6%) subjects had diabetes; among the 368 nondiabetics, the prevalence for individual components comprising the metabolic syndrome were: waist circumference greater than 88 cm in 80%, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 50 mg/dl in 66%, triglycerides greater than or equal to 150 mg/dl in 32%, blood pressure greater than or equal to 130/85 mm Hg in 21%, and fasting glucose concentrations greater than or equal to 110 mg/dl in 5%. Three or more of these individual criteria were present in 123 (33.4%) subjects overall. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome did not differ significantly between racial/ethnic groups. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome from lowest to highest quartile of free testosterone concentration was 19.8, 31.3, 46.9, and 35.0%, respectively [P = 0.056 adjusted for body mass index (BMI)]. None of the 52 women with a BMI less than 27.0 kg/m2 had the metabolic syndrome; those in the top BMI quartile were 13.7 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 5.7-33.0) to have the metabolic syndrome compared with those in the lowest quartile. Thirty-eight percent of those with the metabolic syndrome had impaired glucose tolerance compared with 19% without the metabolic syndrome (P < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
The metabolic syndrome and its individual components are common in PCOS, particularly among women with the highest insulin levels and BMI.

The variables assessed were: menstrual cycle characteristics at age 2035y (independent) and records of arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease (dependent). Statistical analysis used the chi-square test and logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders for cardiovascular risk, with significance set at 5%. Women reporting previous menstrual irregularity were associated with increased risk for some CVRF [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.14; CI-95%=1,024.48], when compared with those reporting regular menstrual cycles.

The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is frequently associated with obesity. However, there are very few data about PCOS in morbid obesity, especially with regard to its evolution after bariatric surgery.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to evaluate the response of PCOS to the sustained and marked weight loss achieved by bariatric surgery in morbidly obese women.


DESIGN
This was a longitudinal prospective nonrandomized evaluation.


SETTINGS
The study was performed at an academic hospital.


PATIENTS
Thirty-six consecutive premenopausal women submitted to bariatric surgery were screened for PCOS, which was present in 17.


INTERVENTIONS
Bariatric surgery was performed.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Hyperandrogenism, menstrual function, and insulin resistance were estimated before and at least 6 months after bariatric surgery in 12 patients with PCOS.


RESULTS
Weight loss (41 +/- 9 kg after 12 +/- 5 months) was paralleled by decreases in the hirsutism score (from 9.5 +/- 6.8 to 4.9 +/- 4.2; P = 0.001), total (69 +/- 32 to 42 +/- 19 ng/dl; P < 0.02) and free testosterone (from 1.6 +/- 0.7 to 0.6 +/- 0.3 ng/dl; P < 0.005), androstenedione (from 4.1 +/- 1.5 to 3.0 +/- 0.9 ng/ml; P < 0.02), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (from 2000 +/- 1125 to 1353 +/- 759 ng/ml; P < 0.005); amelioration of insulin resistance estimated by homeostasis model assessment (from 6.0 +/- 3.0 to 1.6 +/- 1.0; P < 0.001); and restoration of regular menstrual cycles and/or ovulation in all patients.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been shown to cause a reduction in quality of life. This study examines the extent of different PCOS symptoms on quality-of-life, psychosocial well-being and sexual satisfaction.


METHODS
Complete metabolic, hormonal, clinical and psychosocial data were obtained from a total of 120 women with PCOS. Patients were compared with 50 healthy women to establish reductions in quality-of-life and emotional well-being. In addition, the correlation between psychosocial variables and the major clinical PCOS features obesity (body mass index (BMI)), excessive body hair (hirsutism score), acne, hyperandrogenism (serum testosterone levels), disturbed insulin regulation (area under the insulin response curve and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), menstrual cycle disturbances and infertility were analyzed.


RESULTS
PCOS patients showed significant reductions in quality-of-life, increased psychological disturbances, and decreased sexual satisfaction when compared with healthy controls. BMI and hirsutism scores, but not the presence of acne, were associated with physical aspects of quality-of-life and sexual satisfaction. No clear effect of androgens or insulin resistance on psychosocial variables was detected. Similarly, the type of menstrual cycle disturbances or infertility had no impact on psychological well-being.


CONCLUSION
In PCOS, changes in appearance, particularly obesity and hirsutism, reduce physical dimensions of quality-of-life and decrease sexual satisfaction. The role of biochemical, endocrine and metabolic parameters as well as menstrual irregularities and infertility appeared to be less important.

Sixty-nine young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [age 25.2+/- 4.7 years, with body mass index (BMI) 24.3 +/- 4.8 kg/m2; mean 6 SD] and 73 age-matched healthy females (BMI 22.3 +/- 3.3 kg/m2; mean +/- SD) were evaluated for the occurrence of features of metabolic syndrome according to the Adult Treatment Panel III.


RESULTS
Overt metabolic syndrome (the presence of three and more risk factors) was not more common in PCOS women (1/64, 1.6%) than in healthy controls (0/73, 0%). On the other hand, in nearly 50% of PCOS women isolated features of metabolic syndrome, most often a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, were found. Women with at least one feature of metabolic syndrome were, in comparison with women without any of these features, significantly more obese (P = 0.0001), with lower insulin sensitivity (P = 0.05). When comparing PCOS women according to the degree of insulin sensitivity, as determined by euglycaemic clamp, isolated features of metabolic syndrome were found in 8/17 women above the upper quartile, compared with 11/16 women below the lower quartile of insulin sensitivity (P = 0.20).

The aim of this study was to evaluate metabolic syndrome frequency, cardiovascular risk profile and premature carotid artery atherosclerosis in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) especially during early adulthood.


METHODS
A case-control study was conducted on 43 young women (18-22 years of age) with PCOS and 43 age-matched volunteer controls. Anthropometrical measurements, hormone levels, lipid and glucose profile were obtained from all subjects. Two different criteria were used to assess metabolic syndrome (MS) frequency. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the independent cardiovascular risk factors that predict IMT.


RESULTS
MS was diagnosed in 11.6% (n = 5) of women with PCOS compared to no cases in the control group (P = 0.02). The mean IMT was significantly higher in PCOS subjects (0.746 +/- 0.106 mm) compared to controls (0.608 +/- 0.105 mm, P < 0.001). Among many cardiovascular risk factors evaluated, the diagnosis of PCOS, increased body mass index and decreased sex hormone-binding globulin were significant independent predictors of increased IMT.


CONCLUSIONS

Changes in androgen levels across the adult female life span and the effects of natural menopause and oophorectomy have not been clearly established.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to document the effects of age on androgen levels in healthy women and to explore the effects of natural and surgical menopause.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A cross-sectional study was conducted of 1423 non-healthcare-seeking women, aged 18-75 yr, randomly recruited from the community over 15 months.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Serum levels by age of total testosterone (T), calculated free T, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androstenedione in a reference group of women free of confounding factors. Women in the reference group had no usage of exogenous steroid therapy; no history of tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy; and no hyperprolactinemia or polycystic ovarian syndrome. The effects of natural and surgical menopause on sex steroid levels were also examined.


RESULTS
In the reference population (n = 595), total T, calculated free T, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androstenedione declined steeply with age (P < 0.001), with the decline of each being greater in the earlier than the later decades. Examination of serum androgen levels by year in women aged 45-54 yr showed no independent effect of menopausal status on androgen levels. In women aged 55 yr or older, those who reported bilateral oophorectomy and were not on exogenous steroids had significantly lower total T and free T levels than women 55 yr or older in the reference group.


CONCLUSIONS
We report that serum androgen levels decline steeply in the early reproductive years and do not vary because a consequence of natural menopause and that the postmenopausal ovary appears to be an ongoing site of testosterone production. These significant variations in androgens with age must be taken into account when normal ranges are reported and in studies of the role of androgens in women.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2005,839.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '8766902', 'name': 'S.

174,fdd92ebcf3ab9db5faf30e4086eaa372fac35b1f,Serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels remain high until late reproductive age and decrease during metformin therapy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"BACKGROUND
Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is secreted by granulosa cells of ovarian early developing follicles and its serum levels have been shown to correlate with small antral follicle number. Since the pronounced androgen secretion from follicles/stroma in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains until late reproductive age, and since AMH reflects the number of antral follicles, it was of interest to study the possible age-related relationship between AMH, androgens and follicle number in women with PCOS and in control women. Moreover, the possible effect of metformin on serum AMH levels and the relationship to follicle count and volume were studied.


METHODS
Forty-four healthy women (aged 21-44 years) and 65 women with previously diagnosed PCOS (aged 16-44 years) participated in the study. Serum basal AMH levels were correlated with those of serum androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol (E2), LH, FSH and inhibin B, and with follicle number. The effect of metformin on serum AMH concentrations, follicle number and ovarian volume was studied in 26 women (aged 20-41 years) with PCOS after 6 months of treatment.


RESULTS
Serum AMH levels were 2- to 3- fold higher in PCOS women than in healthy women. In control women, serum AMH levels correlated positively with those of serum androstenedione (r = 0.564, P < 0.001) and testosterone (r = 0.328, P = 0.036) and negatively with serum FSH concentrations (r = -0.374, P = 0.012) and age (r = -0.691, P<0.001). In women with PCOS, serum AMH levels correlated positively with those of androstenedione (r = 0.311, P = 0.011) and testosterone (r = 0.310, P = 0.011) and with follicle count (r = 0.352, P = 0.012), and negatively with age (r = -0.300, P = 0.014). Serum AMH levels, the number of antral follicles and ovarian volume decreased significantly during metfromin treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
Serum AMH levels decreased with age both in healthy women and in women with PCOS, although they were always 2- to 3-fold higher and remained elevated until 40 years of age in PCOS subjects. Thus, since serum AMH levels correlate well with antral follicle count and serum androgen levels, the measurement of AMH could be used as a tool to assess ovarian ageing, to diagnose polycystic ovaries/PCOS and to evaluate treatment efficacy.",Human Reproduction,2005,266.0,"['Medicine', 'Biology']","[{'authorId': '10050890', 'name': 'T.

Mean follow-up was between 2 and 3 yr for both groups (PCOS 2.5 +/- 1.7 yr; controls 2.9 +/- 2.1 yr). Based on World Health Organization glucose tolerance categories, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of glucose intolerance at follow-up in the PCOS group. In the PCOS group, 25 (37%) had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and seven (10%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline, compared with 30 (45%) and 10 (15%), respectively, at follow-up. There were also no differences within groups (PCOS or control) or between groups (PCOS vs. control) in the oral glucose tolerance test-derived measure of insulin sensitivity, but in the women with PCOS who converted to either IGT or type 2 diabetes mellitus, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.0001). At the follow-up visit, the mean glycohemoglobin level was 6.1 +/- 0.9% in women with PCOS vs. 5.3 +/- 0.7% in the control women (P < 0.001). Women with PCOS and baseline IGT had a low conversion risk of 6% to type 2 diabetes over approximately 3 yr, or 2% per year. The effect of PCOS, given normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at baseline, is more pronounced with 16% conversion to IGT per year. Our study supports that women with PCOS (especially with NGT) should be periodically rescreened for diabetes due to worsening glucose intolerance over time, but this interval may be over several years and not annually.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2005,309.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '6133498', 'name': 'R.

Experts have recommended including the morphology and volume of the ovary in the diagnostic criteria for PCOS. We performed this study to determine whether there was an association between the morphology and size of the ovaries and markers of insulin sensitivity as determined by dynamic testing within women with PCOS or compared with a group of control women. We then examined reproductive parameters. We studied 88 unrelated PCOS women and 21 control women, aged 17-45 yr. All were in the early follicular phase or its equivalent (no follicle with > 10 mm diameter and anovulatory serum progesterone level < 3 ng/ml). Subjects underwent on the same day a phlebotomy for baseline hormones, a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, and transvaginal ultrasound to determine the morphology and volume of the ovaries. Ninety-five percent (84 of 88) of women with PCOS and 48% (10 of 21) of the control women had polycystic ovaries using the criteria of at least one ovary greater than 10 cm3 (PCOV) and/or polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) using the criteria of 10 or more peripheral follicular cysts 8 mm in diameter or less in one plane along with increased central ovarian stroma. PCOM was a better discriminator than PCOV between PCOS and control women. The odds of women with PCOS having PCOM were elevated 50-fold compared with controls (odds ratio, 50; 95% confidence interval, 10-240; P < 0.0001), whereas the odds of PCOV were elevated 5-fold in women with PCOS (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-12.6; P = 0.003). Neither the insulin sensitivity index, fasting or 2-h values, or any integrated measures of glucose and insulin varied in women according to either morphology or volume, nor was there an association with circulating androgen levels. Women with PCOS and PCOM had lower FSH levels than women with PCOS and non-PCOM. Women with PCOS and PCOV had a higher LH to FSH ratio than women without PCOV and PCOS. These data support the hypothesis that polycystic ovaries are an abnormal finding. However, neither the morphology nor the volume of the ovaries is associated with distinctive metabolic or reproductive phenotypes in women with PCOS.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2005,124.0,"['Medicine', 'Biology']","[{'authorId': '6133498', 'name': 'R.

Undisputedly, COC suppress androgen production, thus ameliorating skin androgenic symptoms and improving menstrual dysfunction. On the other hand, there are still many unresolved issues concerning their metabolic effects. COC could decrease insulin sensitivity and deteriorate glucose tolerance, although the negative influence on insulin sensitivity is dependent on other factors (especially obesity) and this need not be expressed in non-obese patients. It is probable that the impairment of glucose tolerance is reversible, as the incidence of diabetes is not increased in past COC users. The effects of COC on the lipid spectrum are dependent on the type of gestagen, but lipid levels usually remain within the reference limits. Combination therapy of COC with weight reduction or insulin sensitizers could further suppress androgen levels and improve metabolic parameters. The establishment of COC after laparoscopic ovarian drilling may further decrease androgen levels. The combination of COC and GnRH analogues is not superior to COC therapy alone. Prospective data about the influence of COC on the risk of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and endometrial cancer in PCOS women are lacking.",Human Reproduction Update,2005,136.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '6842644', 'name': 'J.

Insulin resistance also plays a role in the metabolic syndrome (MBS). We hypothesized that the MBS is prevalent in PCOS and that women with both conditions would present with more hyperandrogenism and menstrual cycle irregularity than women with PCOS only. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all women with PCOS seen over a 3-yr period at an endocrinology clinic. Of the 161 PCOS cases reviewed, 106 met the inclusion criteria. The women were divided into two groups: 1) women with PCOS and the MBS (n = 46); and 2) women with PCOS lacking the MBS (n = 60). Prevalence of the MBS was 43%, nearly 2-fold higher than that reported for age-matched women in the general population. Women with PCOS had persistently higher prevalence rates of the MBS than women in the general population, regardless of matched age and body mass index ranges. Acanthosis nigricans was more frequent in women with PCOS and the MBS. Women with PCOS and the MBS had significantly higher levels of serum free testosterone (P = 0.002) and lower levels of serum SHBG (P = 0.001) than women with PCOS without the MBS. No differences in total testosterone were observed between the groups. We conclude that the MBS and its components are common in women with PCOS, placing them at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Women with PCOS and the MBS differ from their counterparts lacking the MBS in terms of increased hyperandrogenemia, lower serum SHBG, and higher prevalence of acanthosis nigricans, all features that may reflect more severe insulin resistance.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2005,824.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '10279315', 'name': 'T.

Adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have significant disruption in health-related quality of life (HRQL) compared to their healthy peers, but it is unclear which aspects of the disorder have the greatest impact on these quality-of-life changes. Studies of adult women have indicated that weight status has a significant impact on subjective symptomatology; however, a similar effect of weight status on HRQL in adolescents with PCOS has not been established. This study evaluated the effect of body mass index (BMI) on quality-of-life disturbances in adolescent girls with PCOS.


METHODS
Data were derived from the Adolescent PCOS Quality of Life Study, a cross-sectional study of healthy (n = 186) and PCOS-affected adolescent girls (n = 97). The study was conducted at an urban, hospital-based adolescent medicine clinical practice. Medical staff obtained anthropomorphic measurements. Participants in both groups completed the Child Health Questionnaire-Version CF-87 as a measure of HRQL. BMI was tested as a mediator of HRQL using bivariate analyses and multivariate linear regression models.


RESULTS
The average BMI was 31.7 kg/m(2) (standard deviation [SD] = 8.4) for adolescents with PCOS and 23.5 kg/m(2) (SD = 4.2) for healthy adolescents. BMI was associated with PCOS status and HRQL. Girls with PCOS scored lower on the general health perceptions scale, physical functioning scale, family activities scale, and the general behavior scale and higher on the change in health in the last year subscale. When BMI was added to the multivariate linear regression models, coefficients were reduced on average by 3 points and became nonsignificant, indicating that the HRQL differences are mediated by the higher BMI.


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates that BMI is a primary mediator in the relationship between PCOS and the HRQL reductions experienced by girls with the disorder. Clinical interventions that effectively address weight issues in adolescents with PCOS may improve overall HRQL and other obesity-related clinical outcomes.",Ambulatory Pediatrics,2005,138.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '144169143', 'name': 'M.

Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia are well-recognized characteristics of anovulatory women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) but, paradoxically, steroidogenesis by PCOS granulosa cells remains responsive to insulin. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that insulin resistance in the ovary is confined to the metabolic effects of insulin (i.e. glucose uptake and metabolism), whereas the steroidogenic action of insulin remains intact.


METHODS
Granulosa-lutein cells were obtained during IVF cycles from seven women with normal ovaries, six ovulatory women with PCO (ovPCO) and seven anovulatory women with PCO (anovPCO). Mean body mass index was in the normal range in all three groups. Granulosa-lutein cells were cultured with insulin (1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng/ml) and LH (1, 2.5 and 5 ng/ml). Media were sampled at 24 and 48 h and analysed for glucose uptake, lactate production and (48 h only) progesterone production.


RESULTS
Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by cells from anovPCO was attenuated at higher doses of insulin (100 and 1000 ng/ml) compared with that by cells from either ovPCO (P=0.02) or controls (P=0.02). Insulin and LH stimulated lactate production in a dose-dependent manner, but insulin-dependent lactate production was markedly impaired in granulosa-lutein cells from anovPCO compared with either normal (P=0.002) or ovPCO (P<0.0001). By contrast, there was no difference in insulin-stimulated progesterone production between granulosa-lutein cells from the three ovarian types.


CONCLUSIONS
Granulosa-lutein cells from women with anovPCOS are relatively resistant to the effects of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and utilization compared with those from normal and ovPCO, whilst maintaining normal steroidogenic output in response to physiological doses of insulin. These studies support the probability of a post-receptor, signalling pathway-specific impairment of insulin action in PCOS.",Human Reproduction,2005,184.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '121023875', 'name': 'S.

After adjustment for age and body mass index, PCOS was a significant predictor of CAC (odds ratio = 2.31; P = 0.049). PCOS subjects were also 4.4 times more likely to meet the criteria for MCS than controls. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and insulin appeared to mediate the PCOS influence on CAC. Interestingly, total testosterone was an independent risk factor for AC in all subjects after controlling for PCOS, age, and body mass index (P = 0.034).

189,a326c1cc089fa00fbf89ca2feb4e2fc3f0927ab6,Changes in anti-Müllerian hormone serum concentrations over time suggest delayed ovarian ageing in normogonadotrophic anovulatory infertility.,"BACKGROUND
Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), produced by growing pre-antral and early antral ovarian follicles, has been shown to be a useful marker for ovarian ageing. Serum AMH concentrations are elevated during reproductive life in anovulatory women, especially in those patients exhibiting polycystic ovaries (PCO). The current study was designed to investigate whether the decrease in AMH serum concentrations over time is different comparing women with normogonadotrophic anovulation [World Health Organization (WHO) group 2 (including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)] and normo-ovulatory controls.


METHODS AND RESULTS
AMH serum levels were assessed on two occasions in 98 patients suffering from WHO 2 anovulatory infertility as well as in 41 normo-ovulatory premenopausal women. Median time interval between both visits was 2.6 years (range 0.3-9.0) for WHO 2 patients compared with 1.6 years (range 1.0-7.3) in controls. Serum AMH concentrations were significantly (P < 0.0001) elevated on both occasions in WHO 2 patients (AMH1, median = 7.5 microg/l, range 0.1-35.8; and AMH2, median = 6.7 microg/l, range 0.0-30.6) compared with controls (AMH1, median = 2.1 microg/l, range 0.1-7.4; and AMH2, median = 1.3 microg/l, range 0.0-5.0). Regression analysis, corrected for age, indicated a significant relative decrease in serum AMH concentrations over time for both groups (P < 0.001). However, the decline in serum AMH in WHO 2 patients was significantly less compared with controls (P = 0.03).


CONCLUSION
The present longitudinal study shows that serum AMH concentrations decrease over time both in women presenting with WHO 2 anovulatory infertility and in normo-ovulatory controls. The decrease in WHO 2 patients is less pronounced despite distinctly elevated concentrations. This observation may suggest retarded ovarian ageing and hence a sustained reproductive life span in these patients.",Human Reproduction,2004,163.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '40634294', 'name': 'A.

Investigation of a possible effect of metformin on androgen levels in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).


METHODS
A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. Forty pregnant women with PCOS received diet and lifestyle counselling and were randomized to either metformin 850 mg twice daily or placebo. Primary outcome measures were changes in serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, androstenedione, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and free testosterone index. Secondary outcome measures were pregnancy complications and outcome. Two-tailed t-tests and chi2-tests were used.


RESULTS
Maternal androgen levels were unaffected by metformin treatment in pregnant women with PCOS. While none of the 18 women in the metformin group experienced a severe pregnancy or post-partum complication, seven of the 22 (32%) women experienced severe complications in the placebo group (P = 0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
Metformin treatment did not reduce maternal androgen levels in pregnant women with PCOS. In the metformin-treated group we observed a reduction of severe, pregnancy and post-partum complications.

On the question of how to counsel adolescents with irregular menstrual cycles or oligomenorrhoea, no clear answer has been given. Adolescents with oligomenorrhoea especially show endocrine abnormalities and may be at risk for ovulatory dysfunction and the polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood.


METHODS
We followed a cohort of adolescents to document changes in menstrual cycle pattern between ages 15 and 18 years in the general population.


RESULTS
Two per cent (2/128) of adolescents with regular menstrual cycles developed oligomenorrhoea, and 12% (17/148) of those with irregular menstrual cycles did so. Fifty-one per cent (34/67) of the oligomenorrhoeic adolescents remained oligomenorrhoeic. Increase in body mass index (BMI), concentration of LH, androstenedione or testosterone, and polycystic ovaries (PCO) were associated with persistence of oligomenorrhoea. In multivariate analysis only a normal to high BMI (>19.6 kg/m(2)) consistently contributed significantly to predict persistent oligomenorrhoea. Glucose:insulin ratio as a marker for insulin resistance was not associated with an increased risk for oligomenorrhoea.


CONCLUSIONS
Oligomenorrhoea at age 18 years is better predicted by menstrual cycle pattern at age 15 years than by LH or androgen concentrations or PCO at this age.

To compare the influence of transdermal and peroral oestrogen treatments in conjunction with cyproterone acetate (CPA) on metabolic and hormonal parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Twenty-four women with PCOS, aged 25.4+/-4.3 (mean+/-s.d.) years, body mass index 24.5+/-3.9 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to receive either transdermal oestradiol plus CPA (n=12) or a peroral oestradiol-CPA combination (n=12). Before and after 3 months of treatment, basal blood samples, euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp combined with indirect calorimetry and arginine tests were performed. ANOVA and Student's t-test or Wilcoxon's test were used for statistical analyses.


RESULTS
After peroral oestradiol-CPA, insulin sensitivity (P<0.004) and the disposition index as the function of insulin sensitivity and secretion (P<0.0001) decreased significantly. Fasting insulin (P<0.05), cholesterol (P<0.05), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P<0.05) and sex-hormone binding globulin (P<0.0001) increased significantly. Dehydroepiandrosterone (P<0.05) and 17-OH progesterone (P<0.01) decreased significantly. After transdermal oestradiol+CPA, no significant changes were observed in sex-hormone binding globulin and androgen concentrations, insulin sensitivity or disposition index.


CONCLUSIONS
In women with PCOS, peroral oestrogens (at doses common in combined oral contraceptives) led to a significant impairment in insulin secretion and action.

A total of 518 cases with oligomenorrhea and/or hirsutism and 1036 randomly selected controls were analyzed. C-Reactive protein (CRP; median, 0.70 vs. 0.60 mg/liter; P = 0.026), triglycerides (mean, 0.97 vs. 0.91 mmol/liter; P = 0.039), body mass index (BMI; mean, 25.1 vs. 24.2 kg/m(2); P < 0.001), and waist/hip ratio (mean, 0.82 vs. 0.81; P = 0.001) were significantly higher, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower (mean, 1.60 vs. 1.66 mmol/liter; P = 0.002) in the cases compared with the controls. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure showed no statistically significant differences between the cases and the controls. In terms of metabolic CVD risk factors, women reporting hirsutism alone were indistinguishable from the control group, and those who reported both oligomenorrhea and hirsutism had the most severe changes in risk factor profiles. Because obesity is strongly related to PCOS symptoms, the analyses were stratified by BMI. After stratification into normal weight (BMI, <25 kg/m(2)), overweight (25 kg/m(2) <or= BMI <30 kg/m(2)), and obese (BMI, >or=30 kg/m(2)) groups, the waist/hip ratio was significantly higher among the overweight cases (mean, 0.84 vs. 0.83; P = 0.04). Among the obese women, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly lower (mean, 1.32 vs. 1.48 mmol/liter; P = 0.002) among the cases, and triglycerides tended to be higher (mean, 1.43 vs. 1.27 mmol/liter; P = 0.068) than in controls.

In normogonadotropic anovulatory infertile women [World Health Organization (WHO) class 2], the number of early antral follicles is usually increased. To investigate whether AMH concentrations are increased, serum levels in 128 WHO 2 women were compared with those in 41 normoovulatory premenopausal women of similar age. Serum AMH concentrations are significantly (P < 0.001) elevated in WHO 2 patients [median, 7.6 micro g/liter (range, 0.1-40.0)], compared with controls [median, 2.1 micro g/liter (0.1-7.4)]. In 106 patients presenting with polycystic ovaries (PCOs) (>/=="" BORDER=""0"">12 follicles/ovary measuring 2-9 mm and/or an ovarian volume > 10 ml), AMH levels were elevated [9.3 micro g/liter (1.8-40.0)], compared with 22 patients without PCOs [6.4 micro g/liter (0.1-22.1)] (P < 0.0001). In WHO 2 patients, AMH concentrations correlated with features characteristic for polycystic ovary syndrome such as LH concentrations (r = 0.331; P = 0.0001), testosterone levels (r = 0.477, P = 0.0001), mean ovarian volume (r = 0.421; P = 0.0001), and the number of ovarian follicles (r = 0.308; P = 0.0001). AMH levels correlated well with age in WHO 2 patients (r = -0.248; P = 0.002) as well as in controls (r = -0.465; P = 0.005). However, the relative decline in AMH with age is less pronounced in WHO 2 patients. In a subset of patients no significant correlation was found between AMH serum concentrations and the FSH response dose, the duration of stimulation, and the total number of ampoules of FSH used. In conclusion, serum AMH concentrations are elevated in WHO 2 women, especially in those patients exhibiting PCOs. Because AMH concentrations correlated well with other clinical, endocrine, and ultrasound markers associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, AMH may be used as a marker for the extent of the disease. A less pronounced AMH decrease over time in these women may suggest retarded ovarian aging.

Given that Asian Indians are insulin resistant and prone to metabolic syndrome at an earlier age, we assessed glucose/insulin ratio and intimal medial thickness (IMT) in young women with PCOS from south India. In this cross-sectional case control study, we assessed insulin resistance and carotid IMT in 40 women presenting with hyperandrogenic features of PCOS. Insulin resistance was assessed by fasting glucose/insulin ratio and IMT by the Doppler system with electrical linear transducer midfrequency of 12 MHz. Women with PCOS had higher fasting insulin levels (36.58 +/- 17.81 muU/mL, vs. 16.60 +/- 3.22 muU/mL in controls; p < 0.001), higher insulin resistance (glucose/insulin ratio 2.81 +/- 1.47 vs. 5.47 +/- 1.46 in controls; p < 0.001), and greater IMT (0.53 +/- 0.14 mm vs. 0.39 +/- 0.06 mm in controls; p < 0.001).

201,5fa3f4932bcccfa98dc00072da09a8ac3e77743b,Prevalence of polycystic ovaries in women with androgenic alopecia.,"OBJECTIVE
Although androgenic alopecia is recognised to be a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it is not known whether polycystic ovaries (PCO) and associated endocrine abnormalities are present in patients who present with alopecia as a primary complaint. We therefore set out to determine the strength of the association between androgenic alopecia and PCO. We examined the prevalence of ultrasound-based polycystic ovarian morphology and associated clinical and biochemical features in a large multiethnic group of women whose presenting complaint was of alopecia, and in a control group.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
We studied 89 women of mixed ethnic origin with androgenic alopecia and compared them to 73 control women. A detailed history was taken, anthropometry was performed and assessment of body-hair distribution was made. The presence of PCO was established by pelvic ultrasound scan. Serum gonadotrophins, testosterone, androstenedione, dihydrotestosterone and sex hormone binding globulin concentrations were measured.


RESULTS
Women with alopecia had a higher prevalence of PCO and hirsutism than the control population (PCO: 67% vs 27%, P<0.00001; hirsutism: 21% vs 4%, P=0.003). Women with alopecia (with or without PCO) had higher testosterone, androstenedione and free androgen index than controls, even though few had frankly abnormal androgens.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings confirm an association between androgenic alopecia and PCO, and other symptoms of hyperandrogenaemia. Thus most women who present with androgenic alopecia as their primary complaint also have PCO and have indices of abnormal androgen production. Since PCO is a well known risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes, this association has important implications for long-term management.",European Journal of Endocrinology,2003,90.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '50656572', 'name': 'E.

The aim of this trial, in which hirsutism was the primary end point, was to compare the efficacy of the oral antihyperglycemic medication metformin with that of an established treatment, combined ethinyl estradiol and cyproterone acetate. Patients (n = 52) were randomized to receive either metformin (500 mg, three times daily) or Dianette (ethinyl estradiol, 35 micro g; cyproterone acetate, 2 mg) treatment for 12 months, with assessments before treatment, at 6 months, and at 12 months. Both objective and subjective methods of evaluating hirsutism were used, and in addition, patient perceptions were examined. The results show that metformin is potentially an effective treatment for moderate to severe hirsutism in women with PCOS. They also suggest that in some respects (Ferriman-Gallwey score and patient self-assessment), it is more efficacious than the standard treatment (Dianette). The objective evaluation of hair diameter reduction showed that both treatments were moderately effective at multiple anatomical sites. Dianette treatment was responsible for profound suppression of androgen activity, in contrast to metformin, which induced negligible change. However, metformin did reduce markers of insulin resistance. The data suggest that hirsutism may be effectively treated by reducing hyperinsulinemia.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2003,203.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '3993787', 'name': 'L.

Information on the prospective association of this definition for coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes is currently limited. Methods and Results—We used a modified NCEP definition with body mass index in place of waist circumference. Baseline assessments in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study were available for 6447 men to predict CHD risk and for 5974 men to predict incident diabetes over 4.9 years of follow-up. Mean LDL cholesterol was similar but C-reactive protein was higher (P <0.0001) in the 26% of men with the syndrome compared with those without. Metabolic syndrome increased the risk for a CHD event [univariate hazard ratio (HR)=1.76 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.15)] and for diabetes [univariate HR=3.50 (95% CI 2.51 to 4.90)]. Metabolic syndrome continued to predict CHD events (HR=1.30, 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.67, P =0.045) in a multivariate model incorporating conventional risk factors. Men with 4 or 5 features of the syndrome had a 3.7-fold increase in risk for CHD and a 24.5-fold increase for diabetes compared with men with none (both P <0.0001). C-reactive protein enhanced prognostic information for both outcomes. With pravastatin, men with the syndrome had similar risk reduction for CHD as compared with those without (HR, 0.73 and 0.69; pravastatin versus placebo).

However, premature coronary atherosclerosis has not been demonstrated in PCOS women. Electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) noninvasively measures coronary artery calcium (CAC), a marker for coronary atherosclerosis. We measured CAC by EBCT in 30- to 45-yr-old premenopausal PCOS women and compared the results to CAC in 1) recruited normal ovulatory volunteers matched for age and weight to the PCOS cohort, and 2) community-dwelling women of similar age in an extant coronary calcium database. Healthy, community-dwelling, ovulatory controls (n = 71) were matched by age and body mass index (BMI) to PCOS women (n = 36). Women with diabetes or known CHD were excluded. Subjects underwent EBCT scanning, oral glucose tolerance testing, and CHD risk factor assessment. PCOS women had significantly higher levels of serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and testosterone levels than matched controls. PCOS and control women were obese and had a greater mean BMI than community-dwelling women (33 kg/m(2) for PCOS vs. 31 kg/m(2) for control; P < 0.001). CAC was more prevalent in PCOS women (39%) than in matched controls (21%; odds ratio, 2.4; P = 0.05) or community-dwelling women (9.9%; odds ratio, 5.9; P < 0.001). BMI, waist circumference, and total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels predicted CAC prevalence after adjustment for BMI. CAC is more prevalent in PCOS women than in obese or nonobese women of similar age.

The mechanisms behind this lipolysis defect were explored in vitro; sc fat cells were obtained from 10 young, nonobese PCOS women and from 14 matched, healthy control women. Fasting plasma glycerol levels were reduced by one third in PCOS (P < 0.05). Adipocytes of PCOS women were about 25% larger than in the controls (P < 0.05) and had 40% reduced noradrenaline-induced lipolysis (P < 0.05), which could be attributed to a 10-fold decreased beta(2)-adrenoceptor sensitivity (P < 0.05) and low ability of cAMP to activate the protein kinase A (PKA)/hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) complex (P < 0.05). In PCOS, the adipocyte protein content of beta(2)-adrenoceptors, HSL, and the regulatory II beta-component of PKA were 70%, 55%, and 25% decreased, respectively (P < 0.001); but there was no change in the amount of the catalytic subunit of PKA or of beta(1)-adrenoceptors. Thus, lipolytic catecholamine resistance of sc adipocytes in PCOS is probably attributable to a combination of decreased amounts of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors, the regulatory II beta-component of PKA, and HSL.

Higher medians of serum testosterone (T) (2.10 vs. 1.90 nmol/liter, P < 0.001), LH (5.40 vs. 4.85 U/liter, P = 0.005), insulin (53.8 vs. 51.66 pmol/liter, P = 0.040), and free androgen index (FAI) (4.01 vs. 3.03, P < 0.001) and lower glucose/insulin ratio (91.1 x 10(8) vs. 94.9 x 10(8), P = 0.048) and SHBG (52.4 vs. 60.7 nmol/liter, P < 0.001) were observed among the cases, but no difference was observed in cortisol and glucose levels between the cases and controls. Of all the women in the cohort, 10.2% reported only oligomenorrhea and had biochemical findings similar to the whole case group. Those who reported only hirsutism (10.4%) were in between the case and control groups according to biochemical findings. The subjects who reported both oligomenorrhea and hirsutism (3.4%) had the highest T, LH, FAI, insulin, and glucose and the lowest SHBG and glucose/insulin ratio, compared with the case group and the groups with either symptom only indicating a dose-response manner in typical endocrine profile of PCOS by adding up symptoms. The levels of T and FAI were higher and SHBG lower in groups with overweight or obesity both at 14 and 31 yr, compared with groups with normal weight at 14 yr and overweight or obesity at 31 yr. In the group with normal weight at 14 and 31 yr and the group with overweight or obesity at 14 yr but normal weight at 31 yr, the levels of T and FAI were lowest and SHBG highest. T and FAI were higher and SHBG lower among the cases than the controls in groups stratified by weight development from adolescence to adulthood. In conclusion, this longitudinal study of a large, stable population indicates that women with self-reported symptoms of hirsutism and/or oligomenorrhea show endocrine characteristics of PCOS and can be detected in a general population using simple questions.

214,dca0b540ec13e65436bacf6f4b41ee6f93e09c88,New Approach to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Other Forms of Anovulatory Infertility,"Anovulation can be classified in the clinic on the basis of serum hormone assays. Low gonadotropins along with low estrogen concentrations are suggestive of a central origin of the disease, whereas low estrogen levels along with elevated gonadotropins indicate a primary defect at the ovarian level. Most anovulatory patients (approximately 80%) present with serum FSH and estradiol levels within the normal range (World Health Organization class II). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common but poorly defined heterogeneous clinical entity. Historically, characteristic ovarian abnormalities represented a hallmark of the syndrome. Because several etiological factors may lead to a similar end point (i.e., polycystic ovaries), the development of a clinically applicable classification of the syndrome has proven difficult. Clinical, morphological, biochemical, endocrine, and, more recently, molecular studies have identified an array of underlying abnormalities and added to the confusion concerning the pathophysiology of the disease. Despite the vast literature regarding the etiology and classification of PCOS, no consensus has been reached regarding the validity of criteria used to diagnose the syndrome. For instance, the significance of elevated serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations, insulin resistance or polycystic-appearing ovaries assessed by ultrasound for PCOS diagnosis remains uncertain. In contrast, hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation generally are believed to be mandatory diagnostic features. Patients with PCOS might visit a dermatologist for hirsutism, a generalist, or internist for complaints related to obesity or a gynecologist for irregular or absent bleeding. However, most patients seek the care of a gynecologist because of cycle abnormalities (oligomenorrhea) and infertility. In PCOS, serum FSH and estradiol (E2) levels are usually found to be within the (broad) normal ranges, whereas LH may either be normal or elevated. Because PCOS with normal or high LH does not seem to represent different clinical entities, it seems justifiable to consider this syndrome as a subgroup of WHO II patients, although estrogen levels may be tonically elevated in these patients. This review will focus on characteristics of the heterogeneous group of WHO–II patients in an attempt to identify factors involved in the etiology and possible ovulation induction outcome of PCOS.

215,efdce69fb01c67cce3918fa17d9455217b767e9c,Polycystic ovarian syndrome and insulin resistance in white and Mexican American women: a comparison of two distinct populations.,"OBJECTIVES
We sought to determine what differences, if any, existed between white and Mexican American women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and whether the same values for fasting insulin, fasting glucose/insulin ratio, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) might be applied when screening both ethnic groups for insulin resistance.


STUDY DESIGN
Eighty-three consecutive women suspected to have PCOS but who demonstrated absence of other endocrine disorders comprised the study population. Nineteen healthy ovulatory women volunteered as controls. Fasting serum samples were obtained for determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, glucose, insulin, free and total testosterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the early proliferative phase. An oral glucose load was administered, and blood samples for glucose and insulin were drawn at 1, 2, and 3 hours. Those with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus were excluded from our final study population. Four different groups were defined: (1) women with PCOS and insulin resistance, (2) women with PCOS without insulin resistance, (3) women with irregular cycles but without PCOS or another identifiable endocrinopathy, and (4) regular, cycling control subjects. Each group was subdivided by ethnicity (white or Mexican American). A total of 65 white and 37 Mexican American women were studied, including control subjects.


RESULTS
Among all study participants, Mexican American women with PCOS had significantly higher mean values for body mass index, fasting insulin, and HOMA but lower mean fasting glucose/insulin levels than white women. When group 1 patients (PCOS with insulin resistance) were compared between ethnic groups, mean fasting insulin and HOMA levels were significantly lower and glucose/insulin ratios higher in white than in Mexican American women. A single cutoff value for insulin resistance in PCOS was insensitive when applied to both ethnic groups. A fasting insulin value >20 microU/mL, HOMA value > 3.8, and glucose/insulin value <7.2 were reasonable screening values in our population of white women, whereas a fasting insulin value >23 microU/mL, HOMA value >4.5, and glucose/insulin ratio <4.0 were feasible screening values in Mexican American women.


CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that (1) Mexican American women with PCOS are more insulin resistant than white women, (2) the incidence of insulin resistance is higher in Mexican American women with PCOS than in white women, (3) a single ""screening"" value for PCOS-related insulin resistance screening cannot be applied to both white and Mexican American women, and (4) normative values for insulin resistance screening in the PCOS population should be individualized for different racial or ethnic populations.",American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,2002,169.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '35067764', 'name': 'R.

However, prospective data are lacking on the relationship between menstrual cycle irregularity and subsequent CVD risk. The objective of this study was to assess prospectively the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke associated with a history of irregular menstrual cycles. The study design was a prospective cohort study of 82,439 female nurses who provided information in 1982 on prior menstrual regularity (at ages 20-35 yr) and were followed through 1996 for cardiovascular events. Incident reports of nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal CHD, and nonfatal and fatal stroke were made. Medical records were reviewed for confirmation. During 14 yr (1,155,915 person-yr) of follow-up, there were 1417 incident cases of CHD and 838 incident cases of stroke, including 471 cases of ischemic stroke. Compared with women reporting a history of very regular menstrual cycles, women reporting usually irregular or very irregular cycles had an increased risk for nonfatal or fatal CHD [age-adjusted relative risks (RR), 1.25 and 1.67, respectively; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.07-1.47 and 1.35-2.06, respectively]. Increased risks for CHD associated with prior cycle irregularity remained significant after adjustment for body mass index and several potential confounders. There was a nonsignificant increase in overall stroke risk (RR, 1.30; 95% CI = 0.97-1.74) and in ischemic stroke risk (RR, 1.40; 95% CI = 0.97-2.04) associated with very irregular cycles.

Three hundred and thirty-six women with PCOS, 307 sisters of these probands, and 47 control women were studied. The sisters were grouped by phenotypes: PCOS [hyperandrogenemia (HA) with chronic oligo- or amenorrhea, n = 39], HA with regular menses (n = 36), unaffected (UA; n = 122), and unknown (n = 110). The analyses were adjusted for age and body mass index. PCOS and HA sisters of women with PCOS had similar and significantly elevated fasting insulin levels (P = 0.001) as well as similar and significantly decreased fasting glucose/insulin ratios (P < 0.001) suggestive of insulin resistance compared with UA sisters and control women. Markers of insulin resistance were associated with hyperandrogenemia and not with menstrual irregularity. PCOS sisters also had decreased levels of SHBG (P = 0.02) suggestive of higher ambient insulin levels. PCOS sisters had increased levels of proinsulin (P = 0.04) compared with control women, which suggested pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in this group of sisters. The magnitude of obesity also differed significantly among the groups of sisters. The PCOS sisters were significantly more obese than all the other groups, and the HA sisters were more obese than the UA sisters. We conclude that markers of insulin resistance are associated with hyperandrogenemia rather than menstrual irregularity in the sisters of women with PCOS.

Although recent data demonstrate that insulin resistance is present in the early stages of PCOS, the prevalence of insulin resistance in adolescents with PCOS has not been determined. Likewise, the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in adolescent cohorts has not been established. In this study we sought to obtain preliminary data regarding the prevalence of IGT and DM in adolescents with PCOS and to assess the ability of screening tests to predict these abnormalities within this population. Twenty-seven adolescents with PCOS underwent oral glucose tolerance tests. Plasma glucose and insulin levels were obtained at baseline, and glucose was measured 2 h after a 75-g glucose challenge. The 2-h plasma glucose level was used to categorize subjects as having IGT or the provisional diagnosis of DM. Eight of our 27 subjects had IGT, and 1 had previously undiagnosed DM. These abnormalities were seen among lean and obese subjects. Fasting plasma glucose levels and simple measures of insulin resistance were suboptimal predictors of IGT and DM within our cohort. As in adults, our results indicate that adolescents with PCOS are at increased risk for IGT and DM and that the 2-h plasma glucose level after an oral glucose challenge appears to be the most reliable screening test for these abnormalities. Our results need to be corroborated by future studies that determine the prevalence of abnormalities in glucose tolerance among large populations of adolescents, both with and without PCOS. However, as DM may be preventable by lifestyle modifications, we would recommend that adolescents with PCOS undergo periodic screening for abnormal glucose tolerance using 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose levels.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2002,351.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '3304907', 'name': 'M.

However, PCOS has a strong resemblance to the insulin resistance (metabolic) syndrome, where an increased rate of visceral fat cell lipolysis is believed to play a pathophysiological role. We hypothesized that primary defects in visceral lipolysis might also exist in PCOS. Ten young, nonobese, and otherwise healthy PCOS women were compared with 13 matched control women. In vitro lipolysis regulation and stoichiometric properties of the final step in lipolysis activation, namely the protein kinase A (PKA)-hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) complex, were investigated in isolated visceral (i.e., omental) fat cells. Body fat distribution and circulating levels of insulin, glucose, and lipids were normal in PCOS women. However, in vivo insulin sensitivity was slightly decreased (P = 0.03). Catecholamine-induced adipocyte lipolysis was markedly (i.e., about twofold) increased in PCOS women due to changes at the postreceptor level, although there was no change in the antilipolytic properties of visceral fat cells. Western blot analyses of visceral adipose tissue showed twofold increased levels of the catalytic and the regulatory Ialpha components of PKA. In contrast, the regulatory RIIbeta component of PKA was almost 50% decreased in visceral adipose tissue in PCOS women. Recent studies on genetically modified mice have shown that a similar transition in the regulatory PKA units induces an increased lipolytic response to catecholamines. Further analysis showed that the level of HSL-short, an enzymatically inactive splice form of HSL, was decreased in PCOS (P < 0.01). The altered lipolysis in PCOS is different from that observed in visceral fat cells in the insulin resistance syndrome that occurs at the level of adrenergic receptors. We concluded that increased catecholamine-induced lipolysis in visceral fat cells may be due to unique alterations in the stoichiometric properties of the adipose PKA-HSL holoenzymes.

Subjects were 67 women with PCOS (mean age +/- standard deviation, 28.8 +/- 6.6 years). Baseline characteristics included age and height. Trunk-leg fat ratio and trunk-leg muscle ratio were assessed with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were measured with radioimmunoassays. Relationships among serum testosterone levels, body fat and muscle mass distribution were investigated using Pearson and partial correlation tests. Serum testosterone levels were positively correlated with trunk-leg fat ratio (r = 0.398, P < 0.01), but were inversely correlated with trunk-leg muscle ratio (r = -0.332, P < 0.05). Trunk-leg muscle ratio was inversely correlated with trunk-leg fat ratio (r = -0.360, P < 0.01). Serum testosterone levels were still correlated with trunk-leg fat ratio (r = 0.500, P < 0.001) and trunk-leg muscle ratio (r = -0.286, P < 0.05), after adjusting for age and height. Trunk-leg fat ratio was still correlated with trunk-leg muscle ratio, after adjusting for age, height, and serum testosterone levels.

Although oligomenorrhea has been associated cross-sectionally with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, it is not known whether oligomenorrhea is a marker for increased future risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).


OBJECTIVE
To prospectively assess risk of type 2 DM in women with a history of long or highly irregular menstrual cycles.


DESIGN AND SETTING
The Nurses' Health Study II, a prospective observational cohort study.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 101 073 women who had no prior history of DM and who reported their usual menstrual cycle pattern at age 18 to 22 years on the baseline (1989) questionnaire.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Incident reports of DM, with follow-up through 1997, compared among women categorized by menstrual cycle length (5 categories).


RESULTS
During 564 333 person-years of follow-up, there were 507 cases of type 2 DM. Compared with women with a usual cycle length of 26 to 31 days (referent category) at age 18 to 22 years, the relative risk (RR) of type 2 DM among women with a menstrual cycle length that was 40 days or more or was too irregular to estimate was 2.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-2.66), adjusting for body mass index at age 18 years and several other potential confounding variables. The RR of type 2 DM associated with long or highly irregular menstrual cycles was greater in obese women, but was also increased in nonobese women (at body mass indexes at age 18 years of <25, 25-29, and >/=30 kg/m, RRs were 1.67 [95% CI, 1.14-2.45], 1.74 [95% CI, 1.07-2.82], and 3.86 [95% CI, 2.33-6.38], respectively).

Cross-sectional studies have shown a high frequency of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). However, little is known about the change in glucose tolerance that occurs over a period of several years in women with PCOS.


METHODS
Sixty-seven women with PCOS received a 75 g glucose tolerance test and measurement of lipids at baseline and at follow-up after an average time of 6.2 years. All women followed prospectively had normal glucose tolerance (n = 54) or IGT (n = 13) at the start of the study.


RESULTS
Change in glycaemic control from baseline was frequent, with 5/54 (9%) of normoglycaemic women at baseline developing IGT and a further 4/54 (8%) moving directly from normoglycaemic to NIDDM. For women with IGT at baseline, 7/13 (54%) had NIDDM at follow-up. Body mass index (BMI) at baseline was an independent significant predictor of adverse change in glycaemic control.


CONCLUSIONS
Women with PCOS, particularly those with a high BMI, should be reviewed regularly with respect to IGT or NIDDM, as the frequency of impaired glycaemic control is high, and that the rate of conversion from normal glucose tolerance to IGT or NIDDM, or from IGT to NIDDM is substantial.",Human Reproduction,2001,345.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '145792919', 'name': 'R.

Combined oral contraceptives (COC) remain the first choice for the treatment of hyperandrogenism in most patients. However, differences in endocrine and metabolic parameters between obese and lean patients have been postulated. This is the first study evaluating the effect of COC treatment in obese versus non-obese PCOS patients. In total, 28 lean [body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m(2))] and 15 obese (BMI >30 kg/m(2)) women patients were enrolled in the study. The concentrations of androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and lipids were measured before and after 6 months of treatment with COC containing low-androgenic progestins. Clinical androgenic symptoms were monitored. There was a lower concentration of SHBG in obese patients, but there were no differences in androgen concentrations between both groups before the study. Highly significant changes in concentrations of testosterone (P < 0.001), androstenedione (P < 0.0001), SHBG (P < 0.001) and LH (P = 0.01) were demonstrated in lean patients, with only less significant changes in SHBG (P < 0.01) and testosterone (P < 0.05) in obese patients during the study. Clinical androgenic symptoms improved significantly (P = 0.05) only in the group of lean women. No reduction in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio was observed in either group.

Four hundred and ten premenopausal women with PCOS in a multicenter, double blind trial were randomly assigned to 44 weeks of treatment with placebo (PBO) or troglitazone [150 mg/day (TGZ-150), 300 mg/day (TGZ-300), or 600 mg/day (TGZ-600)]. We compared changes in ovulatory function (by monitoring the urinary level of pregnanediol-3-glucuronide daily), hirsutism (by a modified Ferriman-Gallwey scoring method), hormonal levels (total and free testosterone, androstenedione, sex hormone-binding globulin, LH, FSH, and the LH/FSH ratio), and measures of glycemic parameters (fasting levels of glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A(1c), and the glucose and insulin areas under the curve during an oral glucose challenge) among study groups. Of the 410 patients recruited, 305 (74.4%) met evaluability criteria and were included in the analyses. The patients' baseline characteristics were similar across all treatment arms. Ovulatory rates were significantly greater for patients receiving TGZ-300 and TGZ-600 than for those receiving PBO (0.42 and 0.58 vs. 0.32; P < 0.05 and 0.0001, respectively). Of PCOS patients treated with TGZ-600, 57% ovulated over 50% of the time compared with 12% of placebo-treated patients. There was a significant decrease in the Ferriman-Gallwey score with TGZ-600 compared with PBO (0.22 +/- 0.53 vs. -2.21 +/- 0.49; P < 0.05, respectively).

Nearly all glycemic parameters showed dose-related decreases with troglitazone treatment. The total number and severity of adverse events (including elevations in liver enzymes) and the proportion of patients withdrawn from the study due to the development of adverse effects were similar between treatment groups.

However, a normal LDL‐cholesterol level may be misleading since LDL exists as subpopulations of particles differing in size and atherogenic potential. Smaller LDL particles are more atherogenic and high concentrations often occur in association with elevated circulating triglyceride concentrations (but frequently normal total LDL‐cholesterol), increased hepatic lipase activity (HL) and insulin resistance.

Preliminary data suggest that androgens may play a role in the male predominance of apnea. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by menstrual disturbances, androgen excess, and frequently obesity. These features suggest that women with PCOS may be at increased risk for OSA. To determine whether obese women with PCOS have an increased prevalence of sleep apnea compared with age and weight-matched reproductively normal women, we performed overnight polysomnography for determination of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in 18 obese women with PCOS and age and weight-matched control women.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are strongly associated with insulin resistance and hypercytokinemia, independently of obesity. We hypothesized that women with PCOS are at risk for OSA and EDS. Fifty-three women with PCOS (age range, 16-45 yr) and 452 control premenopausal women (age range, 20-42), from a general randomized sample for the assessment of prevalence of OSA, were evaluated in the sleep laboratory for 1 night. In addition, women with PCOS were tested for plasma free and weakly bound testosterone, total testosterone, and fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations. In this study, PCOS patients were 30 times more likely to suffer from sleep disordered breathing (SDB) than the controls [odds ratio = 30.6, 95% confidence interval (7.2-139.4)]. Nine of the PCOS patients (17.0%) were recommended treatment for SDB, in contrast with only 3 (0.6%) of the control group (P < 0.001). In addition, PCOS patients reported more frequent daytime sleepiness than the controls (80.4% vs. 27.0%, respectively; P < 0.001). PCOS patients who were recommended treatment for SDB, compared with those who were not, had significantly higher fasting plasma insulin levels (306.48 +/- 52.39 vs. 176.71 +/- 18.13 pmol/L, P < 0.01) and a lower glucose-to-insulin ratio (0.02 +/- 0.00 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.00, P < 0.05). Plasma free and total testosterone and fasting blood glucose concentrations were not different between the two groups of PCOS women. Our data indicate that SDB and EDS are markedly and significantly more frequent in PCOS women than in premenopausal controls. Also, insulin resistance is a stronger risk factor than is body mass index or testosterone for SDB in PCOS women.

Women with PCOS are at significantly increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Studies in isolated adipocytes and in cultured skin fibroblasts from PCOS women have demonstrated intrinsic postbinding defects in insulin-mediated glucose metabolism. In fibroblasts, the mitogenic pathway of insulin action is intact, consistent with a selective defect in insulin signaling. While PCOS skeletal muscle is resistant to insulin in vivo, cultured muscle cells have normal insulin sensitivity, consistent with a major role of extrinsic factors in producing insulin resistance in this tissue. Excessive serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or downstream signaling proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in PCOS. The putative serine kinase is extrinsic to the insulin receptor but its identity is unknown. The explanations for tissue-specific and signaling pathway-specific differences in insulin action in PCOS are unknown but may involve differential roles of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 in insulin signal transduction.",Recent Progress in Hormone Research,2001,150.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '35225660', 'name': 'A.

In this 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter trial, 137 postmenopausal women (41-60 years of age) with AGA received finasteride 1 mg/day or placebo. Efficacy was evaluated by scalp hair counts, patient and investigator assessments, assessment of global photographs by a blinded expert panel, and histologic analysis of scalp biopsy specimens.


RESULTS
After 1 year of therapy, there was no significant difference in the change in hair count between the finasteride and placebo groups. Both treatment groups had significant decreases in hair count in the frontal/parietal (anterior/mid) scalp during the 1-year study period. Similarly, patient, investigator, and photographic assessments as well as scalp biopsy analysis did not demonstrate any improvement in slowing hair thinning, increasing hair growth, or improving the appearance of the hair in finasteride-treated subjects compared with the placebo group. Finasteride was generally well tolerated.


CONCLUSION
In postmenopausal women with AGA, finasteride 1 mg/day taken for 12 months did not not increase hair growth or slow the progression of hair thinning.",Journal of American Academy of Dermatology,2000,248.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4685472', 'name': 'V.

An adverse lipid profile has also been observed in PCOS-affected women, suggesting that these individuals may be at increased risk for coronary heart disease at a young age. The objective of the present study was to evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis among women with PCOS and age-matched control subjects. A total of 125 white PCOS cases and 142 controls, aged ≥30 years were recruited. Collection of baseline sociodemographic data, reproductive hormone levels, and cardiovascular risk factors was conducted from 1992 to 1994. During follow-up (1996 to 1999), these women underwent B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid arteries for the evaluation of carotid intima-media wall thickness (IMT) and the prevalence of plaque. A significant difference was observed in the distribution of carotid plaque among PCOS cases compared with controls: 7.2% (9 of 125) of PCOS cases had a plaque index of ≥3 compared with 0.7% (1 of 142) of similarly aged controls (P =0.05). Overall and in the group aged 30 to 44 years, no difference was noted in mean carotid IMT between PCOS cases and controls. Among women aged ≥45 years, PCOS cases had significantly greater mean IMT than did control women (0.78±0.03 versus 0.70±0.01 mm, P =0.005). This difference remained significant after adjustment for age and BMI (P <0.05). These results suggest that (1) lifelong exposure to an adverse cardiovascular risk profile in women with PCOS may lead to premature atherosclerosis, and (2) the PCOS-IMT association is explained in part by weight and fat distribution and associated risk factors. There may be an independent effect of PCOS unexplained by the above variables that is related to the hormonal dysregulation of this condition.","Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology",2000,523.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4840412', 'name': 'E.

PCOS usually manifests at puberty and is currently recognized as one of the most common endocrine disorders among women of reproductive age, affecting approximately 4% of this population (4). Women with PCOS typically have acyclic production of 17b-estradiol, with circulating concentrations similar to those seen in the follicular phase of cycling women, but considerably lower than the mean 17b-estradiol concentration observed across the normal menstrual cycle (1). This static level of 17b-estradiol, with the absence of the estradiol surge associated with ovulation, would intuitively be expected to negatively affect bone density. Testosterone and androstenedione, however, are produced in excess by the PCOS ovary and perhaps by the adrenals of some affected women. This chronic elevation in androgens may exert a positive influence on bone in PCOS women, either directly through androgen receptors on bone-related cells or indirectly after conversion to 17b-estradiol and estrone, respectively, in peripheral tissues. Moreover, elevated circulating insulin levels, also associated with PCOS, may offer some additional protection against a reduction in bone mass in these women. Hyperinsulinemia has been shown to positively affect bone density (5, 6) through direct stimulatory effects on osteoblastic activity (7) and by the suppressive influences exerted by insulin on the production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (8) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding proteins (IGFBPs) (9). This insulininduced suppression of these binding proteins may result in increased exposure of target tissues, including bone, to the stimulatory effects of elevated concentrations of free sex steroids and IGFs. Both thin and obese women develop PCOS, a presentation that allows for evaluation of the effects of life-long obesity, alterations in body composition (e.g. increased central adiposity), and related metabolic abnormalities (e.g. hyperandrogenemia and hyperinsulinemia) on the skeleton. The relatively high prevalence of PCOS and its early-life presentation render this disorder of particular importance as a model for assessing the effects of androgen and potentially insulin on the attainment of maximal bone mass. The objectives of this review article are to 1) summarize the literature exploring the androgen-bone mass relationship in normal women; 2) assess the effects of PCOS, androgen excess, and androgen-estrogen balance on bone mass in women; 3) examine study design issues related to PCOS, androgen excess, and bone mass; and 4) suggest areas for future research related to the influence of PCOS, androgen excess, and insulin on bone in women.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2000,82.0,"['Medicine', 'Biology']","[{'authorId': '32026164', 'name': 'J.

To determine whether testosterone levels change as women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) grow older.


DESIGN
A follow-up cross-sectional study of a cohort of women with PCOS identified up to 20-25 years ago.


SETTING
Women with PCOS were recruited primarily from practice records between 1970 and 1990. Voter registration tapes and household directories were used to identify age-, race-, and neighborhood-matched controls.


PARTICIPANT(S)
Eighty-four women with PCOS, 20-57 years of age, and 37 age-matched controls participating in a study of the risk for cardiovascular disease in women with PCOS.


INTERVENTION(S)
Clinical data were collected by questionnaire and fasting blood samples were obtained randomly throughout the menstrual cycle.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
Total and non-SHBG-bound testosterone levels.


RESULT(S)
Total and non-SHBG-bound testosterone levels were similar in women with PCOS who were 20-42 years of age but were reduced by approximately 50% among women 42-47 years of age and remained stable in women older than 47 years of age. Testosterone levels were increased in younger and older women with PCOS compared with controls but were similar to controls in women 42-47 years of age.


CONCLUSION(S)
Hyperandrogenism partly resolves before menopause in women with PCOS. This change may explain the tendency of women with PCOS to cycle regularly as they grow older. Testosterone levels remain elevated in older women with PCOS, however, and may contribute to their increased risk for cardiovascular disease, endometrial cancer, and other diseases.",Fertility and Sterility,2000,92.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '3148526', 'name': 'S.

Oral contraceptive pills are commonly used in the treatment of PCOS; but, like metformin, their influence on insulin sensitivity is not well known. We randomized 32 obese (body mass index > 27 kg/m2) women with PCOS, either to metformin (500 mg x 2 daily for 3 months, then 1,000 mg x 2 daily for 3 months) or to ethinyl estradiol (35 microg)-cyproterone acetate (2 mg) oral contraceptive pills (Diane Nova) for 6 months. Metformin significantly decreased the waist-to-hip ratio, serum testosterone, fasting free fatty acid, and insulin concentrations and improved oxidative glucose utilization and menstrual cyclicity, with slight (but nonsignificant) improvements in insulin hepatic extraction and insulin sensitivity. Diane Nova significantly decreased serum testosterone and increased serum sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations and glucose area under the curve during oral glucose tolerance test. It is concluded that metformin, probably by way of its effect on adipose tissue, leads to reduction of hyperinsulinemia and concomitant improvement in the menstrual pattern; and therefore, it offers a useful alternative treatment for obese, anovulatory women with PCOS. Despite slight worsening of glucose tolerance, Diane Nova is an efficient treatment for women with hyperandrogenism and hirsutism.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2000,269.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1384245466', 'name': 'L.

Women registered as having PCOS, based on the combination of oligo- or amenorrhoea and an increased LH concentration, were invited by letter to participate in a questionnaire by telephone. In this questionnaire we asked for the prevalent menstrual cycle pattern, which we scored in regular cycles (persistently shorter than 6 weeks) or irregular cycles (longer than 6 weeks). We interviewed 346 patients of 30 years and older, and excluded 141 from analysis mainly because of the use of oral contraceptives. The remaining 205 patients showed a highly significant linear trend (P < 0.001) for a shorter menstrual cycle length with increasing age. Logistic regression analysis for body mass index, weight loss, hirsutism, previous treatment with clomiphene citrate or gonadotrophins, previous pregnancy, ethnic origin and smoking showed no influence on the effect of age on the regularity of the menstrual cycle. We conclude that the development of a new balance in the polycystic ovary, solely caused by follicle loss through the process of ovarian ageing, can explain the occurrence of regular cycles in older patients with PCOS.",Human Reproduction,2000,76.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4220255', 'name': 'M.

Anthropometric data; the presence of hirsutism, acne, and androgenic alopecia; and the menstrual history were recorded by a single investigator. In 145 women, blood samples were also obtained for measurement of serum androgen levels. PCOS was defined by the presence of 1) oligomenorrhea, 2) clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and 3) exclusion of hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disorders, and nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Hirsutism was defined by a modified Ferriman-Gallwey score of 8 or more, acne was considered as a sign of hyperandrogenism when persistent after the second decade of life, and hyperandrogenemia was defined by an increase in circulating testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate or an increase in the free androgen index above the 95th percentile of the control values derived from the nonhirsute, nonacneic women having regular menses who were not receiving hormonal therapy. PCOS was present in 10(6.5%), hirsutism was present in 11 (7.1%), and acne was present in 19 (12.3%) of the 154 women.

Before and at the end of treatment, hirsutism was quantitatively measured in each subject by determination, by computer-assisted light microscopy, of the largest diameter of 5 hairs plucked from the linea alba. These measurements were averaged to produce a mean hair shaft diameter. For each subject, baseline and posttreatment assessments were carried out at the same time by an investigator blinded to both time and type of therapy. In addition, a semi-quantitative clinical evaluation was carried out by a modification of the Ferriman-Gallwey (F-G) scoring method, performed by a single investigator. At baseline the 4 groups of women had similar hair diameters and F-G scores. After 6 months of therapy all groups of subjects given active drugs showed reductions of their hair diameters, without statistically significant differences among groups (mean change +/- SEM, -11.7+/-5.6%, -18.0+/-6.1%, and -12.6+/-6.7%, respectively, in the spironolactone, flutamide, and finasteride groups).

PCOS has variable clinical phenotypes, biochemical features, and metabolic abnormalities. To determine the prevalence of PCOS in the Greek population as well as the metabolic parameters, we performed a cross-sectional study of 192 women of reproductive age (17-45 yr), living on the Greek island of Lesbos. They were divided into 4 groups according to the presence of hirsutism (defined as a Ferriman-Gallwey score > or = 6) and O/M: group N (n = 108), regular menses and absence of hirsutism; group 1 (n = 56), regular menses and hirsutism; group 2 (n = 10), O/M and absence of hirsutism; and group 3 (n = 18), O/M and hirsutism. Body mass index, waist to hip ratio, and mean blood pressure did not differ among the studied groups. Hormonal profile was assessed by measuring free testosterone (FT). The prevalence of PCOS, defined by the presence of O/M and biochemical hyperandrogenism (FT > or = 95th percentile of the normal women), was estimated to be 6.77% (13 women of 192). Higher FT levels were observed in group 3 (O/M and hirsutism) compared with groups N (P < 0.00001) and 1 (P < 0.0001) and in groups 1 (hirsutism) and 2 (O/M) compared with group N (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.005, respectively). Sex hormone-binding globulin levels were lower in women with PCOS and in groups 1 and 3 than those in group N (P < 0.002, P < 0.02, and P < 0.002, respectively) independently of the body mass index. The metabolic profile was investigated by measurements of fasting glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI), and estimation of the fasting glucose to insulin ratio (FG:I ratio). After covariance adjusted for the BMI, FI levels were higher in group 3 and in women with PCOS than in the normal (P < 0.005 and P < 0.002, respectively) and the hirsute (P < 0.05 and P < 0.02, respectively) women, whereas FG levels did not differ among the studied groups. The FG:I ratio was lower in group 3, group 1, and in women with PCOS than in normal women (P < 0.05). Finally, a high incidence of family history of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.001) and menstrual disorders (P = 0.01) was observed in women with PCOS, in contrast to the normal and hirsute women. In conclusion, PCOS appears to be a particularly common endocrine disorder in the Greek population under study (prevalence, 6.77%); furthermore, it is associated with certain metabolic abnormalities.

257,ff8786a8ca6142e49877f4e5a4b531e140ac031c,Prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE
NIDDM occurs commonly among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The prevalence and natural history of its precursor, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), is less well known. The objective of this study was to characterize the prevalence and incidence of glucose intolerance in a large cohort of women with well-characterized PCOS.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A total of 122 women with clinical and hormonal evidence of PCOS were recruited from the Medicine, Endocrinology, Gynecology, and Pediatrics Clinics at the University of Chicago. All women had a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with measurement of glucose and insulin levels. A subset of 25 women were subsequently restudied with the aim of characterizing the natural history of glucose tolerance in PCOS.


RESULTS
Glucose tolerance was abnormal in 55 (45%) of the 122 women: 43 (35%) had IGT and 12 (10%) had NIDDM at the time of initial study. The women with NIDDM differed from those with normal glucose tolerance in that they had a 2.6-fold higher prevalence of first-degree relatives with NIDDM (83 vs. 31%, P < 0.01 by chi 2) and were significantly more obese (BMI 41.0 +/- 2.4 vs. 33.4 +/- 1.1 kg/m2, P < 0.01). For the entire cohort of 122 women, there was a significant correlation between fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations (r = 0.76, P < 0.0001); among the subset with IGT, the fasting glucose concentration was poorly predictive of the 2-h level (r = 0.25, NS). After a mean follow-up of 2.4 +/- 0.3 years (range 0.5-6.3), 25 women had a second OGTT. The glucose concentration at 2 h during the second glucose tolerance test was significantly higher than the 2-h concentration during the first study (161 +/- 9 vs. 139 +/- 6 mg/dl, P < 0.02).


CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of IGT and NIDDM in women with PCOS is substantially higher than expected when compared with age- and weight-matched populations of women without PCOS. The conversion from IGT to NIDDM is accelerated in PCOS. The fasting glucose concentration does not reliably predict the glucose concentration at 2 h after an oral glucose challenge, particularly among those with IGT, the subgroup at highest risk for subsequent development of NIDDM. We conclude that women with PCOS should periodically have an OGTT and must be closely monitored for deterioration in glucose tolerance.",Diabetes Care,1999,1258.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4967211', 'name': 'D.

We performed this study to determine the prevalence of glucose intolerance and parameters associated with risk for this in PCOS women. Two-hundred and fifty-four PCOS women, aged 14-44 yr, were prospectively evaluated at 2 centers, 1 urban and ethnically diverse (n = 110) and 1 rural and ethnically homogeneous (n = 144). The rural PCOS women were compared to 80 control women of similar weight, ethnicity, and age. A 75-g oral glucose challenge was administered after a 3-day 300-g carbohydrate diet and an overnight fast with 0 and 2 h blood samples for glucose levels. Diabetes was categorized according to WHO criteria. The prevalence of glucose intolerance was 31.1% impaired glucose intolerance (IGT) and 7.5% diabetes. In nonobese PCOS women (body mass index, <27 kg/m2), 10.3% IGT and 1.5% diabetes were found. The prevalence of glucose intolerance was significantly higher in PCOS vs. control women (chi2 = 7.0; P = 0.01; odds ratio = 2.76; 95% confidence interval = 1.23-6.57). Variables most associated with postchallenge glucose levels were fasting glucose levels (P < 0.0001), PCOS status (P = 0.002), waist/hip ratio (P = 0.01), and body mass index (P = 0.021). The American Diabetes Association criteria applied to fasting glucose significantly underdiagnosed diabetes compared to the WHO criteria (3.2% vs. 7.5%; chi2 = 4.7; P = 0.046; odds ratio = 2.48; 95% confidence interval = 1.01-6.69). We conclude that 1) PCOS women are at significantly increased risk for IGT and type 2 diabetes mellitus at all weights and at a young age; 2) these prevalence rates are similar in 2 different populations of PCOS women, suggesting that PCOS may be a more important risk factor than ethnicity or race for glucose intolerance in young women; and 3) the American Diabetes Association diabetes diagnostic criteria failed to detect a significant number of PCOS women with diabetes by postchallenge glucose values.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,1999,1771.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '6133498', 'name': 'R.

259,c258348ed829fb89bbc85ebbe07aa4896deb8047,Evidence for a genetic basis for hyperandrogenemia in polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Our preliminary family studies have suggested that some female first-degree relatives of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have hyperandrogenemia per se. It was our hypothesis that this may be a genetic trait and thus could represent a phenotype suitable for linkage analysis. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined 115 sisters of 80 probands with PCOS from unrelated families. PCOS was diagnosed by the combination of elevated serum androgen levels and </=6 menses per year with the exclusion of secondary causes. The sisters were compared with 70 healthy age- and weight-comparable control women with regular menses, no clinical evidence of hyperandrogenemia, and normal glucose tolerance. Twenty-two percent of the sisters fulfilled diagnostic criteria for PCOS. In addition, 24% of the sisters had hyperandrogenemia and regular menstrual cycles. Circulating testosterone (T) and nonsex hormone-binding globulin-bound testosterone (uT) levels in both of these groups of sisters were significantly increased compared with unaffected sisters and control women (P < 0.0001 for both T and uT). Probands, sisters with PCOS, and hyperandrogenemic sisters had elevated serum luteinizing hormone levels compared with control women. We conclude that there is familial aggregation of hyperandrogenemia (with or without oligomenorrhea) in PCOS kindreds. In affected sisters, only one-half have oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia characteristic of PCOS, whereas the remaining one-half have hyperandrogenemia per se. This familial aggregation of hyperandrogenemia in PCOS kindreds suggests that it is a genetic trait. We propose that hyperandrogenemia be used to assign affected status in linkage studies designed to identify PCOS genes.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1998,657.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '6133498', 'name': 'R.

The present prospective longitudinal follow-up study was designed to identify whether certain criteria assessed during standardized initial screening could predict the response to ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate (CC) in 201 patients presenting with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea and infertility. Serum FSH levels were within the normal range (1-10 IU/L), and all patients underwent spontaneous or progestin-induced withdrawal bleeding. Initial CC doses were 50 mg daily for 5 days starting on cycle day 3. In the case of an absent response, doses were increased to 100 and 150 mg daily in subsequent cycles. First ovulation with CC was used as the end point. After a complete follow-up (in the case of a nonresponse, at least 3 treatment cycles with daily CC doses up to 150 mg), 156 patients (78%) ovulated. The free androgen index (FAI = testosterone/sex hormone-binding globulin ratio), body mass index (BMI), cycle history (oligomenorrhea vs. amenorrhea), serum androgen (testosterone and/or androstenedione) levels, and mean ovarian volume assessed by transvaginal sonography were all significantly different (P < 0.01) in responders from those in nonresponders. FAI was chosen to be the best predictor in univariate analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve in a multivariate prediction model including FAI, BMI, cycle history, and mean ovarian volume was 0.82. Patients whose ovaries are less likely to respond to stimulation by FSH due to CC treatment can be predicted on the basis of initial screening characteristics, such as FAI, BMI, cycle history (oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea), and mean ovarian volume. These observations may add to ongoing discussion regarding etiological factors involved in ovarian dysfunction in these patients and classification of normogonadotropic anovulatory infertile women.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,1998,302.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '3386874', 'name': 'B.

To develop a self-administered questionnaire for measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).


METHODS
We identified a pool of 182 items potentially relevant to women with PCOS through semistructured interviews with PCOS patients, a survey of health professionals who worked closely with PCOS women, and a literature review. One hundred women with PCOS completed a questionnaire in which they told us whether the 182 items were relevant to them and, if so, how important the issue was in their daily lives. We included items endorsed by at least 50% of women in the analysis plus additional items considered crucial by clinicians and an important subgroup of patients in a factor analysis. We chose items for the final questionnaire taking into account both item impact (the frequency and importance of the items) and the results of the factor analysis.


RESULTS
Over 50% of the women with PCOS labelled 47 items as important to them. Clinicians chose 5 additional items from the infertility domain, 4 of which were identified as important by women who were younger, less educated, married, and African-American. The Cattell's Scree plot from a factor analysis of these 51 items suggested 5 factors that made intuitive sense: emotions, body hair, weight, infertility, and menstrual problems. We chose the highest impact items from these 5 domains to construct a final questionnaire, the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire (PCOSQ), which includes a total of 26 items and takes 10-15 minutes to complete.


CONCLUSIONS
We have used established principles to construct a questionnaire that promises to be useful in measuring health-related quality of life.

In this prospective study, a weight loss programme was assessed to determine whether it could help obese infertile women, irrespective of their infertility diagnosis, to achieve a viable pregnancy, ideally without further medical intervention. The subjects underwent a weekly programme aimed at lifestyle changes in relation to exercise and diet for 6 months; those that did not complete the 6 months were treated as a comparison group. Women in the study lost an average of 10.2 kg/m2, with 60 of the 67 anovulatory subjects resuming spontaneous ovulation, 52 achieving a pregnancy (18 spontaneously) and 45 a live birth. The miscarriage rate was 18%, compared to 75% for the same women prior to the programme. Psychometric measurements also improved. None of these changes occurred in the comparison group. The cost savings of the programme were considerable. Prior to the programme, the 67 women had had treatment costing a total of A$550,000 for two live births, a cost of A$275,000 per baby. After the programme, the same women had treatment costing a total of A$210,000 for 45 babies, a cost of A$4600 per baby.

These abnormalities, together with obesity, explain the substantially increased prevalence of glucose intolerance in PCOS. Moreover, since PCOS is an extremely common disorder, PCOS-related insulin resistance is an important cause of NIDDM in women (Table 3). The insulin resistance in at least 50% of PCOS women appears to be related to excessive serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. A factor extrinsic to the insulin receptor, presumably a serine/threonine kinase, causes this abnormality and is an example of an important new mechanism for human insulin resistance related to factors controlling insulin receptor signaling. Serine phosphorylation appears to modulate the activity of the key regulatory enzyme of androgen biosynthesis, P450c17. It is thus possible that a single defect produces both the insulin resistance and the hyperandrogenism in some PCOS women (Fig. 19). Recent studies strongly suggest that insulin is acting through its own receptor (rather than the IGF-I receptor) in PCOS to augment not only ovarian and adrenal steroidogenesis but also pituitary LH release. Indeed, the defect in insulin action appears to be selective, affecting glucose metabolism but not cell growth. Since PCOS usually has a menarchal age of onset, this makes it a particularly appropriate disorder in which to examine the ontogeny of defects in carbohydrate metabolism and for ascertaining large three-generation kindreds for positional cloning studies to identify NIDDM genes. Although the presence of lipid abnormalities, dysfibrinolysis, and insulin resistance would be predicted to place PCOS women at high risk for cardiovascular disease, appropriate prospective studies are necessary to directly assess this.",Endocrine reviews,1997,2639.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '6875076', 'name': 'A.

Findings revealed that both women and men have higher levels of receptors and 5alpha-reductase type I and II in frontal hair follices than in occipital follicles, whereas higher levels of aromatase were found in their occipital follicles. There are marked quantitative differences in levels of androgen receptors and the three enzymes, which we find to be primarily in the outer root sheath of the hair follicles in the two genders. Androgen receptor content in female frontal hair follicles was approximately 40% lower than in male frontal hair follicle. Cytochrome P-450-aromatase content in women's frontal hair follicles was six times greater than in frontal hair follicles in men. Frontal hair follicles in women had 3 and 3.5 times less 5alpha-reductase type I and II, respectively, than frontal hair follicles in men.

High levels of the lipostatic hormone, leptin, have also been reported in this condition. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of an oral contraceptive (OC) of low androgenicity containing desogestrel on glucose tolerance in hyperandrogenic women and the impact of changes in androgenic/estrogenic status on leptin concentrations. Sixteen nondiabetic hyperandrogenic women, aged 29 +/- 1 yr with a body mass index (BMI) of 36.8 +/- 1.8 kg/m2, underwent an oral glucose tolerance test before and after 6 months of therapy with the OC. Free testosterone decreased and sex hormone-binding globulin increased after therapy (P < 0.001). Glucose tolerance deteriorated significantly, and two women developed diabetes. Body weight, BMI, and leptin did not change significantly. Leptin correlated with BMI before (r = 0.56; P = 0.02) and after (r = 0.51; P = 0.04) treatment, but not with glucose, insulin, total and free testosterone, or sex hormone-binding globulin before or after treatment. In conclusion, 1) glucose tolerance should be monitored in hyperandrogenic women using OC, even those of low androgenicity; and 2) changes in androgenic/estrogenic status had no effect on the leptin concentration, suggesting that its sexual dimorphism is not related to sex steroids.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,1997,105.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '100781042', 'name': 'S.

Established risk factors for coronary disease in women include smoking [1], high serum cholesterol levels [2], low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels [3], diabetes, and hypertension [2]. Premenopausal women have a lower risk for heart disease than do postmenopausal women [4]. Polycystic ovaries are seen in 22% of women [5, 6] and are associated with hirsutism, infertility, and menstrual disturbances [7]. Insulin resistance [8], higher serum triglyceride levels, and lower HDL cholesterol levels [9] commonly occur in women with polycystic ovaries; these factors may be associated with a higher incidence of coronary artery disease [10, 11]. The metabolic syndrome of hypertension, diabetes, and central obesity (the Stein-Leventhal syndrome) is also associated with polycystic ovaries [12]. We sought to determine whether women with more extensive coronary artery disease (as seen on coronary angiography) are more likely to have polycystic ovaries appearing on ultrasonography than are women with less extensive coronary disease. Methods All women 60 years of age or younger who had had coronary angiography in Auckland, New Zealand, in the preceding 2 years were invited to participate in this study. Women who had had bilateral oophorectomy were excluded. The local ethics committee approved the study. Women who were menstruating were studied between days 5 and 9 of the menstrual cycle. Data were collected on infertility (failure to conceive within 1 year), menstrual cycle irregularity (>a 4-day variation), hypercholesterolemia (requiring medication), hypertension (requiring medication), and a family history of heart disease in a first-degree female relative younger than 60 years of age or in a first-degree male relative younger than 55 years of age. Hirsutism was assessed on the Ferriman-Gallwey scale [13]. Ultrasonography was done prospectively, without knowledge of the coronary angiography results. In consenting patients (71.3%), a transvaginal ultrasound was also done. Polycystic ovaries were defined by modified Adams criteria [14] as eight or more cysts that were between 2 and 8 mm in diameter and were associated with an increase in ovarian stroma. Chest pain (96% of women) or valvular disease (4% of women) was assessed by angiography after administration of nitroglycerin spray. Quantitative angiography was done using a computerized automatic analysis system (Cardiovascular Measurement Systems, Neunen, the Netherlands). The extent of coronary artery disease was evaluated by adding the number of segments containing stenoses of more than 50% diameter according to the Coronary Artery Surgery Study scoring system [15]. A secondary end point was severity of coronary artery disease. Patients were given a score on the basis of luminal diameter narrowing according to the following scale: 25% luminal diameter narrowing, 1 point; 26% to 50%, 2 points; 51% to 75%, 4 points; 76% to 90%, 8 points; 91% to 99%, 16 points; and 100%, 32 points. Each stenosis was multiplied by the appropriate score. Functional significance was evaluated by the Coronary Artery Surgery Study [15] weighting system, which accounts for the severity and location of stenoses. Continuous variables were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Discrete variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Multiple logistic regression analysis was done using the presence or absence of polycystic ovaries as the outcome variable. Explanatory variables include those listed in Table 1 and Table 2 and the extent of coronary artery disease. Explanatory variables were entered into the model in a stepwise fashion if they had a P value of 0.15. These variables included age, extent of coronary artery disease, total cholesterol level, HDL cholesterol level, presence of diabetes, family history of heart disease, and history of smoking. Table 1. Characteristics of Women with Normal Ovaries and Women with Polycystic Ovaries* Table 2. Laboratory Findings in Women with Normal Ovaries and Women with Polycystic Ovaries* Results Of 207 women, 143 (69%) agreed to participate. One or more ovaries were visualized in 99.3% of the study women either by transabdominal (77.6%) or transvaginal (94%) ultrasonography. Neither ovary was visualized in one woman, and her results were excluded. Clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Polycystic ovaries were diagnosed by ultrasonography in 42.3% of women. There was no difference in the prevalence of polycystic ovaries between premenopausal women and postmenopausal women (25 of 48 women and 35 of 94 women, respectively; P = 0.13). The differences in ovaries seen by ultrasonography were present in both premenopausal (follicle-stimulating hormone level < 20 IU/L) and postmenopausal (follicle-stimulating hormone level > 20 IU/L) women [16]. One woman had previously received a diagnosis of the polycystic ovary (Stein-Leventhal) syndrome. Compared with women with normal ovaries, women with polycystic ovaries had higher triglyceride levels (P < 0.01) and lower HDL cholesterol levels (P < 0.05), although more women with polycystic ovaries were receiving lipid-lowering medications (P = 0.01). Compared with women who had normal ovaries, women with polycystic ovaries had higher free testosterone levels (P < 0.001) and a trend for increased C-peptide levels (P = 0.06) (Table 2). These differences all persisted when the data were stratified according to whether the women were premenopausal or postmenopausal [16]. Women with polycystic ovaries had more coronary artery segments with greater than 50% diameter loss (1.7 segments [95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3 segments]) than did women with normal ovaries (0.82 segments [CI, 0.54 to 1.1 segments]) (P < 0.01). Women with polycystic ovaries had a higher functional significance score (1767 [CI, 1123 to 2412]) than did women with normal ovaries (1029 [CI, 709 to 1349]) (P = 0.05) and had a trend toward a higher severity score (39.5 [CI, 29.3 to 49.7] and 28.7 [CI, 22.2 to 35.2], respectively; P = 0.06). Forty-nine women with normal ovaries (59.8%) and 32 women with polycystic ovaries (53.3%) did not have coronary artery stenoses of 50% or more (P > 0.2). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the extent of coronary artery disease was found to be independently associated with the presence of polycystic ovaries (P = 0.032), as was family history of heart disease (P = 0.022). If the extent score increased by 1, the odds ratio increased by approximately 26%. Discussion Our study has three important findings. First, in women having coronary angiography, those with more extensive coronary artery disease were more likely to have polycystic ovaries appearing on sonography than were women with less extensive coronary disease. Second, polycystic ovaries were identified in postmenopausal women. Third, the diagnosis of polycystic ovaries seen on ultrasonography was associated with specific metabolic and endocrine abnormalities. Women with polycystic ovaries have been shown to have risk factors for coronary disease [8-11]. However, a direct association between polycystic ovaries and angiographic coronary artery disease has not been previously reported. Diagnosis of polycystic ovaries in postmenopausal women by ultrasonography has only recently been described [16]. Our finding of a high incidence of polycystic ovaries relates to the patients studied, all of whom had had coronary angiography. The women with polycystic ovaries had high testosterone and triglyceride levels, low HDL cholesterol levels, and some insulin resistance. Women with polycystic ovaries seen on ultrasonography often do not have the clinical features of the polycystic ovarian syndrome. The disorder probably exists on a continuum ranging from no symptoms to the fully developed syndrome. Why should polycystic ovaries appear on ultrasonography more frequently in women with more extensive coronary artery disease than in women with less extensive disease? Polycystic ovaries are the most common cause of anovulation with reduced production of estradiol. Decreased estradiol levels may be associated with coronary artery disease, shown by the reduced incidence of heart disease in postmenopausal women receiving estrogen replacement therapy [17]. Although estrone levels are elevated in women with polycystic ovaries, estrone is less potent than estradiol and may not be cardioprotective. Insulin resistance could be the link between polycystic ovaries and coronary artery disease. We found that C-peptide levels, a stable indicator of insulin production, were higher in women with polycystic ovaries than in women with normal ovaries. Abnormal lipid levels may also account for the increase in significant coronary artery disease. In addition, women with increased testosterone production may have a risk for adverse cardiac events similar to that of men. Hirsutism has also been reported as a risk factor for coronary artery disease in women [18]. What are the implications of our findings? Young women with polycystic ovaries often present with hirsutism, acne, infertility, or menstrual irregularity. Once the diagnosis of polycystic ovaries has been made, lifestyle modifications may be indicated to decrease cardiovascular risk. Further research must be done to investigate the natural history and to determine whether any of the current treatments for polycystic ovaries, such as the oral contraceptive pill, antiandrogens, ovulatory agents, or laparoscopic ovarian surgery, are beneficial.

Patients were divided in three groups according to ultrasound ovarian volumes: group I (n = 16) both ovaries <10 cm3; group II (n = 8) one of the ovaries ≥ 10cm3; and group III (n = 5) both ovaries ≥10 cm3. Serum levels of LH, LH:FSH ratio, testosterone, and androstenedione were significantly higher (p < .05) in group III. Positive predictive value of both ovarian volumes ≥10 cm3 in terms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was 100%, negative predictive value was 81%, sensitivity was 63%, and specificity was 100%.

After the first examination, they were reexamined after a variable period ranging from 2 to 7 y. During the first examination, three basic features of the ovaries were observed: homogeneous (36%), multifollicular (23%), and polycystic (41%). Polycystic ovaries were most frequent, and they generally exceeded the normal adult range. During the last examination, in the entire group of irregular adolescents, homogeneous ovaries decreased (–14%), polycystic ovaries increased (+ 18%), and a further higher number of subjects exceeded the normal adult range (+10%). The subjects with enlarged ovaries had the highest values of LH, testosterone, and androstenedione. Fourteen subjects out of 46 (30%), with normal ovarian volume in the first examination, registered an ovarian enlargement in the last examination, exceeding the normal range. Moreover, a change from the homogeneous or multifollicular structure to the polycystic one was observed. Twenty-one subjects out of 27 (78%) with enlarged ovaries in the first examination confirmed the high ovarian volume and the unchanged structure in the last examination, whereas six subjects (22%) showed ovaries within the normal adult range; the polycystic structure was substantially confirmed. These results indicate the following. 1) Homogeneous, multifollicular, and polycystic ovaries can usually be found in the postmenarcheal period. 2) Enlarged ovaries, polycystic structure, hyperandrogenemia, and high LH values are strongly linked, and they are frequent in irregular cycles even in the absence of signs of hyperandrogenism. These characteristics may all persist or in various aggregations become a permanent feature. 3) Only a few subjects may lose ovarian enlargement and show a change in the polycystic structure; however, they frequently maintain hyperandrogenemia. 4) During the postmenarcheal period, normal ovarian characteristics may suddenly change, and the ovaries may take on a polycystic structure and increase in volume. Moreover, some endocrine parameters may reach pathologic levels.",Pediatric Research,1995,100.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '5893274', 'name': 'S.

281,3ef0c60a0d3ff96bd689d7f3b3902b7100824a6e,Polycystic ovary syndrome: the spectrum of the disorder in 1741 patients.,"The criteria for the diagnosis of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have still not been agreed universally. A population of 1741 women with PCOS were studied, all of whom had polycystic ovaries seen by ultrasound scan. The frequency distributions of the serum concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and prolactin and the body mass index, ovarian volume, uterine cross-sectional area and endometrial thickness were determined and compared with the symptoms and signs of PCOS. Obesity was associated with hirsutism and an elevated serum testosterone concentration and was also correlated with increased rates of infertility and cycle disturbance. The rates of infertility and cycle disturbance also increased with serum LH concentrations > 10 IU/l. A rising serum concentration of testosterone [mean and 95th percentiles 2.6 (1.1-4.8) nmol/l] was associated with an increased risk of hirsutism, infertility and cycle disturbance. The ovarian volume was correlated with serum concentrations of testosterone, LH and the body mass index, which was also correlated with the uterine area. This descriptive data from the largest reported series of women with PCOS enables the development of a management-orientated approach to the syndrome. Women who are overweight can expect an improvement in their symptoms if they lose weight. An elevated concentration of LH (> 10 IU/l) is associated with infertility and treatment should be chosen accordingly. If the serum testosterone concentration is > 4.8 nmol/l, other causes of hyperandrogenism should be excluded.",Human Reproduction,1995,791.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4642288', 'name': 'A.

Relationship to insulin sensitivity and family history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,"The increased prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been ascribed to the insulin resistance characteristic of PCOS. This study was undertaken to determine the role of defects in insulin secretion as well as familial factors to the predisposition to NIDDM seen in PCOS. We studied three groups of women: PCOS with a family history of NIDDM (PCOS FHx POS; n = 11), PCOS without a family history of NIDDM (PCOS FHx NEG; n = 13), and women without PCOS who have a family history of NIDDM (NON-PCOS FHx POS; n = 8). Beta cell function was evaluated during a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, by a low dose graded glucose infusion, and by the ability of the beta cell to be entrained by an oscillatory glucose infusion. PCOS FHx POS women were significantly less likely to demonstrate appropriate beta cell compensation for the degree of insulin resistance. The ability of the beta cell to entrain, as judged by the spectral power for insulin secretion rate, was significantly reduced in PCOS FHx POS subjects. In conclusion, a history of NIDDM in a first-degree relative appears to define a subset of PCOS subjects with a greater prevalence of insulin secretory defects. The risk of developing NIDDM imparted by insulin resistance in PCOS may be enhanced by these defects in insulin secretion.",Journal of Clinical Investigation,1995,445.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '4967211', 'name': 'D.

Case reports and the results of a recent case-control study have raised questions about the potential neoplastic effects of medications used as treatment for infertility.


METHODS
We examined the risk of ovarian tumors in a cohort of 3837 women evaluated for infertility between 1974 and 1985 in Seattle. Computer linkage with a population-based tumor registry was used to identify women in whom tumors were diagnosed before January 1, 1992. Data on infertility testing and treatment were abstracted from the medical records of women who had ovarian cancer and those of a randomly selected comparison group. The risk of ovarian tumors associated with exposure to ovulation-inducing medications was assessed through an age-standardized comparison with the rate of ovarian tumors in the general population, and Cox regression analysis was used to compare the risk of cancer among women who received these medications with the risk among infertile women who did not receive them.


RESULTS
There were 11 invasive or borderline malignant ovarian tumors, as compared with an expected number of 4.4 (standardized incidence ratio, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 4.5). Nine of the women in whom ovarian tumors developed had taken clomiphene; the adjusted relative risk among these women, as compared with that among infertile women who had not taken this drug, was 2.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 11.4). Five of the nine women had taken the drug during 12 or more monthly cycles. This period of treatment was associated with an increased risk of ovarian tumors among both women with ovarian abnormalities and those without apparent abnormalities (relative risk, 11.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 82.3), whereas treatment with the drug for less than one year was not associated with an increased risk.


CONCLUSIONS
Prolonged use of clomiphene may increase the risk of a borderline or invasive ovarian tumor.",New England Journal of Medicine,1994,678.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '3917804', 'name': 'M.

Thirteen Caribbean-Hispanic and 10 non-Hispanic white polycystic ovary syndrome women were compared with 5 Caribbean-Hispanic and 8 non-Hispanic white normal women matched for age, weight, and body composition. All subjects underwent a 2-h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and euglycemic glucose clamp study with a 40 mU.m−2 · min−1 insulin dose. Hepatic glucose production was determined basally and throughout the euglycemic clamp study. Polycystic ovary syndrome was associated with significant increases in fasting insulin levels (P < 0.05) and in 2-h postglucose-load glucose and insulin levels (P < 0.001). Ethnicity was not associated with any changes in these parameters. Polycystic ovary syndrome but not ethnicity was also associated with hepatic insulin resistance, because significant (P < 0.05) residual hepatic glucose production occurred during the euglycemic clamp in the polycystic ovary syndrome women. However, significant independent effects existed for both polycystic ovary syndrome (P < 0.01) and ethnicity (P < 0.05) that resulted in decreased insulin-mediated glucose disposal. Similarly, significant independent effects of polycystic ovary syndrome (P < 0.005) and ethnicity (P < 0.05) occurred, resulting in increased steady-state insulin levels during the euglycemic clamp. This appeared to be, in part, secondary to a decrease in the metabolic clearance rate of insulin associated with ethnicity (P < 0.05). We conclude that polycystic ovary syndrome and ethnicity result in independent and additive decreases in insulin sensitivity in Caribbean-Hispanic women. Insulin resistance resulting in hyperinsulinemia may account for the increased prevalence of both polycystic ovary syndrome and of NIDDM in Caribbean-Hispanic women.",Diabetes,1993,126.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '6875076', 'name': 'A.

Epithelial tumors of low malignant potential in white women. Collaborative Ovarian Cancer Group.,"Epithelial ovarian neoplasms of low malignant potential, also called borderline ovarian tumors, have various features of malignancy, but they do not invade the ovarian stroma. Women with these tumors usually are younger when diagnosed and have better prognoses than do women with invasive tumors. There have been few epidemiologic studies of borderline tumors, and it is unclear whether there are etiologic differences between the two types of tumor behavior. Combined data from nine case-control studies, conducted from 1974 to 1986 and representing 327 white women with tumors of low malignant potential and 4,144 white controls, were used to evaluate the relation between these tumors and personal characteristics related to invasive ovarian cancer. The risk profile for tumors of low malignant potential was found to be similar to that for invasive tumors, with two exceptions: Compared with that of invasive tumors, risk of borderline tumors was less clearly reduced among women who had used oral contraceptives and more clearly elevated among women with a history of infertility.",American Journal of Epidemiology,1992,258.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2107350760', 'name': 'R.

Invasive epithelial ovarian cancers in white women. Collaborative Ovarian Cancer Group.,"Data collected from 2,197 white ovarian cancer patients and 8,893 white controls in 12 US case-control studies conducted in the period 1956-1986 were used to evaluate the relation of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer to reproductive and menstrual characteristics, exogenous estrogen use, and prior pelvic surgeries. Clear trends of decreasing risk were evident with increasing number of pregnancies (regardless of outcome) and increasing duration of breast feeding and oral contraceptive use. Ovarian dysfunction leading to both infertility and malignancy is an unlikely explanation for these trends for several reasons: 1) The trends were evident even among the highly parous; 2) risk among nulliparous women did not vary by marital status or gravidity; and 3) risk among ever-married women showed little relation to length of longest pregnancy attempt or history of clinically diagnosed infertility. Risk was increased among women who had used fertility drugs and among women with long total duration of premenopausal sexual activity without birth control; these associations were particularly strong among the nulligravid. No consistent trends in risk were seen with age at menarche, age at menopause, or duration of estrogen replacement therapy. A history of tubal ligation or of hysterectomy with ovarian conservation was associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk. These observations suggest that pregnancy, breast feeding, and oral contraceptive use induce biological changes that protect against ovarian malignancy, that, at most, a small fraction of the excess ovarian cancer risk among nulliparous women is due to infertility, and that any increased risk associated with infertility may be due to the use of fertility drugs.",American Journal of Epidemiology,1992,978.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '8273596', 'name': 'A.

Nonepithelial Cancers among Adults,"Nonepithelial ovarian cancers are rare, and little is known about their etiology. Of particular interest are the effects of oral contraceptive use and pregnancy, both of which are associated with large decreases in risk for epithelial ovarian cancer. We examined the risk factors for nonepithelial ovarian tumors by combining data from four case-control studies conducted in the United States. We compared personal characteristics of 38 germ cell cases and 45 stromal cases, respectively, with 1,142 and 2,617 general population controls. All subjects were over age 18 years. For germ cell tumors, there was a weak negative association with parity but no consistent pattern of decreasing risk with increasing parity. In contrast, relative to nulligravid women, gravid nulliparous women were at increased risk of developing a germ cell cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 4.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-18.61. The use of oral contraceptives was also associated with elevated risk (OR = 2.0,95% CI = 0.77- 5.1); however, no clear trends in risk were observed. For stromal tumors, oral contraceptive use was associated with decreased risk (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.16-0.83), whereas pregnancy was associated with a small elevation in risk. A trend of increasing risk with increasing age at first term pregnancy was observed, with an odds ratio of 3.6 (95% CI = 1.0-12.5) for a first birth after age 29 years.

Obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome have a greater frequency of menstrual disturbance and of hirsutism than lean women with the syndrome. Initial studies have demonstrated a marked improvement in endocrine function following a short-term, very low calorie diet. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of long-term calorie restriction on clinical as well as biochemical abnormalities in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome.


DESIGN
We performed a within-group comparison of clinical and biochemical indices before and during dietary treatment.


PATIENTS
Twenty-four obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (mean weight 91.5 (SD 14.7) kg) were scheduled for treatment for 6-7 months with a 1000 kcal, low fat diet. Nineteen of the 24 had menstrual disturbances, 12 had infertility and 19 were hirsute.


MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
Thirteen subjects lost more than 5% of their starting weight (range 5.9-22%). In this group there was no significant change in gonadotrophin or total serum testosterone levels but there was a marked increase in concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin (pretreatment: 23.6 (9.5); post-treatment 36.3 (11.8) nmol/l, P = 0.002) and a reciprocal change in free testosterone levels (77 (26) vs 53 (21) pmol/l, P = 0.009). These changes were accompanied by a reduction in fasting serum insulin levels (median (range) 11.2 (5.2-32) vs 2.3 (0.1-13.8) mU/l, P = 0.018) and the insulin response to 75 g oral glucose. There were no significant changes in these indices in the group who lost less than 5% of their initial body weight. Of the 13 women who lost greater than 5% of their pretreatment weight, 11 had menstrual dysfunction. Amongst these women, nine of 11 showed an improvement in reproductive function, i.e. they either conceived (five) or experienced a more regular menstrual pattern. There was a reduction in hirsutism in 40% of the women in this group. By contrast, in the group who lost less than 5% of their initial weight, only one of the eight with menstrual disturbances noted an improvement in reproductive function and none had a significant reduction in hirsutism.


CONCLUSIONS
These data indicate that moderate weight loss during long-term calorie restriction is associated with a marked clinical improvement which reflects the reduction in insulin concentrations and reciprocal changes in SHBG. The improvement in menstrual function and fertility may therefore be consequent upon an increase in insulin sensitivity which, directly or indirectly, affects ovarian function.",Clinical Endocrinology,1992,470.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '7729371', 'name': 'D.

The most obvious biochemical differences between obese and lean women with PCOS is that SHBG concentrations are much lower in women with obesity. The SHBG levels are inversely related to insulin, and insulin has been shown to have a direct inhibitory action on SHBG secretion. Other factors, however, may contribute to the mechanism of the increased prevalence of hirsutism and anovulation in obese women with PCOS, such as a direct effect of insulin or increased activity of 5 alpha-reductase in peripheral tissues.

Twenty six subjects completed 6 months of therapy with 100 mg/day CPA and 19 subjects completed 6 months of 100 mg/day spironolactone. All except 10 subjects received concomitant estrogen therapy. Measured objectively, total hair diameter fell by 17.1% with spironolactone (P less than 0.001), and by 16.8% with CPA (P less than 0.001). The diameter of the hair medulla fell by 17.8% with spironolactone (P less than 0.01), and by 31.7% with CPA (P less than 0.001). There was no difference between the drugs in their effect on hair diameter. Plasma testosterone levels also fell significantly with both drugs. As a subjective assessment of treatment efficacy, the frequency with which subjects performed cosmetic measures was recorded. This fell by 38% with spironolactone and by 44.7% with CPA (P less than 0.001 both drugs), and again there was no difference between the drugs. Side effects caused cessation of treatment in one subject taking CPA and two subjects taking spironolactone, and milder side effects were noted in two further subjects from each treatment group.

Although blood production rates of testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione (A4) were elevated in all of these women, those with upper body obesity (waist-height ratios, greater than 0.85) had higher T and production rates than women with lower body obesity (waist-height ratio less than 0.75). A4 was equally elevated in women with upper and lower body obesity. Peripheral aromatization of A4 to estrone (E1) averaged 1.67% in women with upper body obesity, but was elevated at 2.54% in women with lower body obesity. Urinary E1 production rates averaged 466 +/- 295 nmol/day (172 +/- 109 micrograms/day) in women with upper body obesity. Thus, women with lower body obesity had higher E1 production rates due entirely to increased peripheral aromatization. Women with upper body obesity were observed to have higher serum T and estradiol (E2) levels than women with lower body obesity. Further, upper body obesity was associated with decreased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (16.1 +/- 5.7 nmol/L vs. 18.9 +/- 6.1 in women with lower body obesity). As a result, free T levels averaged 98.8 +/- 39.2 pmol/L in women with upper body obesity vs. 82.2 +/- 33 in women with lower body obesity. Similarly, serum free E2 levels were higher in women with upper body vs. lower body obesity. The data demonstrate that sex hormone production and metabolism are different in morbidly obese women with these differing phenotypes. Women with upper body obesity have higher androgen production rates and higher free T and free E2 levels, whereas women with lower body obesity make increased amounts of E1 from peripheral aromatization.

However, controversy exists as to whether insulin resistance results from PCO or the obesity that is frequently associated with it. Thus, we determined in vivo insulin action on peripheral glucose utilization (M) and hepatic glucose production (HGP) with the euglycemic glucose-clamp technique in obese (n = 19) and nonobese (n = 10) PCO women and age- and body-composition-matched normal ovulatory women (n = 11 obese and n = 8 nonobese women). None had fasting hyperglycemia. Two obese PCO women had diabetes mellitus, established with an oral glucose tolerance test; no other women had impairment of glucose tolerance. However, the obese PCO women had significantly increased fasting and 2-h glucose levels after an oral glucose load and increased basal HGP compared with their body-composition-matched control group. There were statistically significant interactions between obesity and PCO in fasting glucose levels and basal HGP (P < .05). Steady-state insulin levels of ∼100 μU/ml were achieved during the clamp. Insulin-stimulated glucose utilization was significantly decreased in both PCO groups whether expressed per kilogram total weight (P < .001) or per kilogram fat free mass (P < .001) or when divided by the steady-state plasma insulin (I) level (M/I, P < .001). There was residual HGP in 4 of 15 obese PCO, 0 of 11 obese normal, 2 of 10 nonobese PCO, and 0 of 8 nonobese normal women. The metabolic clearance rate of insulin did not differ in the four groups. We conclude that 1) PCO women have significant insulin resistance that is independent of obesity, changes in body composition, and impairment of glucose tolerance, 2) PCO and obesity have a synergistic deleterious effect on glucose tolerance, 3) hyperinsulinemia in PCO is not the result of decreased insulin clearance, and 4) PCO is associated with a unique disorder of insulin action.",Diabetes,1989,1920.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '6875076', 'name': 'A.

Sixty-two women who had an elevation of 1 or more plasma androgen levels were studied. The results in these women, grouped for analysis on the basis of obesity and ovulatory status, were compared to those in 36 control women of similar ages and weights. The anovulatory hyperandrogenic women had the clinical and biochemical features of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO). Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed with measurement of glucose, insulin, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and total and non-SHBG-bound sex steroid levels. AN was present in 29% of the hyperandrogenic women, the majority of them obese. Fifty percent of obese PCO women had AN, but they did not otherwise differ from PCO women lacking this dermatological change. Only women with PCO had significant hyperinsulinemia independent of obesity, and obese PCO women with AN had the highest serum insulin levels. Plasma glucose values during the oral glucose tolerance test were significantly increased in obese PCO women independent of the presence of AN, and 20% of these women had frank impairment of glucose tolerance. Ovulatory hyperandrogenic women had normal insulin levels and glucose tolerance. Obese and nonobese women had different relationships between sex steroid and insulin levels; obese women had significant correlations between insulin and non-SHBG testosterone levels (r = 0.30; P less than 0.05), whereas nonobese women had significant correlations between insulin and FSH (r = 0.40; P less than 0.01), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (r = 0.33; P less than 0.05), and SHBG (r = 0.37; P less than 0.05) levels, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying the association between sex steroid and insulin levels are complex. These findings suggest that 1) only women with PCO have hyperinsulinemia independent of obesity; hyperinsulinemia is not a feature of hyperandrogenic states in general; 2) AN is a common finding in obese hyperandrogenic women, particularly those with PCO; 3) only obese PCO women are at risk for impairment of glucose tolerance, independent of the presence of AN, suggesting that the negative impact of PCO and obesity on insulin action is additive; and 4) PCO women with AN can be considered as a subgroup of PCO and do not appear to have a distinct endocrine disorder.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,1987,605.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '6875076', 'name': 'A.

Over a period of six gynecological years a low ovulation rate (49%) was found in the group of subjects with irregular cycles and regular ovulation was noted in only a few subjects. Slight differences in endocrine pattern and ovarian morphology were observed between the group of adolescents with regular cycles and the group of adults. In contrast, adolescents with irregular menses had higher mean values of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), and androstenedione (A) in comparison with the other two groups both in follicular and premenstrual phases. Nearly 35% of the subjects with irregular cycles had levels of T, A and LH which were higher than the upper limit of the adult normal range. Lower progesterone (P), 17P and oestradiol values were observed in the premenstrual phase. Within the group of subjects with irregular menses, LH levels were higher in anovulatory than in ovulatory cycles, in both phases of the cycle, while T and A levels were higher and prolactin levels were lower in the premenstrual phase of anovulatory cycles. Unlike irregular anovulatory cycles, irregular ovulatory cycles showed a hormonal pattern similar to that found in the adult group. By ultrasound evaluation, a high percentage of subjects with irregular menses had multicystic ovaries (57.9%) and the mean (+/- SEM) ovarian volume was higher (10.6 +/- 0.5 cm3) than that found in adolescents with regular menses (6.7 +/- 0.8 cm3) and in the adult group (7.7 +/- 0.3 cm3). With the increase in frequency and continuity of ovulation an improvement in the direction of adult volume and ovarian structure was observed. Besides the endocrine similarity the data emphasize the striking similarity, already documented by histological studies, between pubertal ovaries and those seen in micropolycystic ovary syndrome. These endocrine and ovarian characteristics are typical of a large number of adolescents with irregular menstrual cycles: these features may be representative of a developmental step toward adult normality, although the possibility of a pathological evolution for some subjects cannot be excluded.",Hormone Research,1986,62.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '5893274', 'name': 'S.

According to epidemiological research, 30~40% of occurrences of bipolar disorder involve a genetic factor. Therefore, environmental factors play a more important role in development of depression. Resilience and resistance to stress are common; therefore, although a certain extent of stress might be received during the embryonic or perinatal period, having a genetic predisposition to mental disorders does not imply that a mental disorder will develop. However, having a genetic predisposition to disorders does weaken resistance to stresses received during puberty, and without the ability to recover, a mental disorder is triggered. The importance of epigenetics in maintaining normal development and biology is reflected by the observation that development of many diseases occurs when the wrong type of epigenetic marks are introduced or are added at the wrong time or in the wrong place. Involvement of genetic and environmental factors in the onset of depression was investigated in relation to epigenetics. When mice with the disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) abnormal gene received isolated rearing stress, depression-like abnormal behaviors and decreased gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the frontal cortex by epigenetical suppression via DNA methylation were observed. Decrease of dopamine in the frontal cortex triggers behavioral disorders. Administration of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist resulted in full recovery from neurological and behavioral disorders. These results suggest a new therapeutic approach to depression.",Experimental Neurobiology,2013,52.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '32421252', 'name': 'T.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by infrequent or absent ovulation (anovulation), high levels of male hormones (hyperandrogenaemia) and high levels of insulin (hyperinsulinaemia secondary to increased insulin resistance). Hyperinsulinaemia is associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk and the development of diabetes mellitus. Insulin-sensitising agents such as metformin may be effective in treating the features of PCOS, including anovulation.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effectiveness of insulin-sensitising drugs in improving reproductive outcomes and metabolic parameters for women with PCOS.


SEARCH METHODS
We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (October 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 3rd Quarter 2011), CINAHL (October 2011), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2011), and EMBASE (January 1985 to October 2011).


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials of insulin sensitising drugs compared with either placebo, no treatment, or an ovulation induction agent for women with PCOS, menstrual disturbance and subfertility.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and trial quality, and extracted data.  


MAIN RESULTS
Forty-four trials (3992 women) were included for analysis, 38 of them using metformin and involving 3495 women.There was no evidence that metformin improved live birth rates, whether it was used alone (pooled OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 6.16, 3 trials, 115 women) or in combination with clomiphene (pooled OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56, 7 trials, 907 women). However, clinical pregnancy rates were improved for metformin versus placebo (pooled OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.51, 8 trials, 707 women) and for metformin and clomiphene versus clomiphene alone (pooled OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.96, 11 trials, 1208 women). In the studies that compared metformin and clomiphene alone, there was evidence of an improved live birth rate (pooled OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.52, 2 trials, 500 women) and clinical pregnancy rate (pooled OR 0.34, 95% 0.21 to 0.55, 2 trials, 500 women) in the group of obese women who took clomiphene.Metformin was also associated with a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances than placebo (pooled OR 4.27, 95% CI 2.4 to 7.59, 5 trials, 318 women) but no serious adverse effects were reported.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
In agreement with the previous review, metformin was associated with improved clinical pregnancy but there was no evidence that metformin improves live birth rates whether it is used alone or in combination with clomiphene, or when compared with clomiphene. Therefore, the role of metformin in improving reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS appears to be limited.",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2012,311.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2250172', 'name': 'T.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a high-protein, low-glycemic-load diet compared with a conventional hypocaloric diet on reproductive hormones, inflammatory markers, lipids, glucose, and insulin levels in obese women with PCOS. Methods: A total of 60 overweight and obese women with PCOS who did not use insulin-sensitizing agents were recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 hypocaloric diet groups for a single-blind clinical trial. The groups included a conventional hypocaloric diet (CHCD) (15% of daily energy from protein) and a modified hypocaloric diet (MHCD) with a high-protein, low-glycemic load (30% of daily energy from protein plus low-glycemic-load foods selected from a list) that was prescribed via counseling visits weekly during 12 weeks of study. Anthropometric assessments and biochemical measurements including reproductive hormones, inflammatory factors, lipids, glucose, and insulin were performed on fasting blood samples at baseline and after 12 weeks of dietary intervention. Results: Weight loss was significant and similar in the 2 groups. Mean of testosterone in the MHCD and CHCD groups decreased from 1.78 ± 0.32 to 1.31 ± 0.26 ng/ml and from 1.51 ± 0.12 to 1.15 ± 0.11 ng/ml, respectively (p < 0.001). Follicle sensitizing hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and blood lipids concentrations were not changed except low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was reduced by 24.5% ± 12.3% (p < 0.001 for both) after 12 weeks of intervention. MHCD resulted in a significant reduction in insulin level, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA), and high-sensitivity C- reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In this study both hypocaloric diets significantly led to reduced body weight and androgen levels in these two groups of women with PCOS.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by oligo- or anovulation (ANOV), biochemical or clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenemia (HA) and PCOs. Four phenotypes of PCOS exist [phenotype 1 (ANOV + HA + PCO), phenotype 2 (ANOV + HA), phenotype 3 (HA + PCO) and phenotype 4 (ANOV + PCO)] but the differences between them are not well studied. We compared markers of insulin resistance (IR) and endocrine characteristics between the different PCOS phenotypes.


METHODS
We prospectively studied 1212 consecutive women with PCOS and 254 BMI-matched healthy women.


RESULTS
Phenotypes 1-4 were present in 48.2, 30.7, 9.7 and 11.4% of patients, respectively. BMI did not differ between the four phenotypes and controls. Both normal weight and overweight/obese women with phenotypes 1 and 2 were more insulin resistant than controls. Overweight/obese, but not normal weight, women with phenotype 4 were more insulin resistant than controls, while IR in women with phenotype 3 did not differ from controls regardless of obesity. In normal weight subjects, women with phenotypes 1 and 2 were more insulin resistant than women with phenotype 4. In overweight/obese subjects, women with phenotype 1 were more insulin resistant than women with phenotypes 2 and 3 and women with phenotype 4 were more insulin resistant than those with phenotype 3. Circulating androgens were higher in normal weight and overweight/obese PCOS patients with phenotypes 1-3 compared with those with phenotype 4, and higher in normal weight PCOS patients with phenotype 1 than in those with phenotype 2.


CONCLUSIONS
Phenotype 1 is associated with more IR and more pronounced HA than phenotype 2. Phenotypes 2 and 4 with obesity, are also characterized by IR.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder, affecting 8-12% of women. Lifestyle modification, including increased physical activity, is the first-line approach in managing PCOS. A systematic review was performed to identify and describe the effect of exercise as an independent intervention on clinical outcomes in PCOS.


METHODS
Five databases were searched with no time limit. A pre-specified definition of PCOS was not used. Studies were included if exercise therapy (aerobic and/or resistance) could be evaluated as an independent treatment against a comparison group. Outcomes measured included cardiovascular risk factors [insulin resistance (IR), lipid profiles, blood pressure and weight] and reproductive measures (ovulation, menstrual regularity and fertility outcomes). Quality analysis was performed based on the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews and the Quality of Reporting of Meta-Analyses checklist.


RESULTS
Eight manuscripts were identified (five randomized controlled trials and three cohort studies). All studies involved moderate intensity physical activity and most were of either 12 or 24 weeks duration with frequency and duration of exercise sessions ranging between studies. The most consistent improvements included improved ovulation, reduced IR (9-30%) and weight loss (4.5-10%). Improvements were not dependant on the type of exercise, frequency or length of exercise sessions.


CONCLUSIONS
Exercise-specific interventions in PCOS are limited. Studies vary considerably in design, intensity and outcome measures; therefore conclusive results remain elusive.

The clinical manifestation of PCOS varies from a mild menstrual disorder to severe disturbance of reproductive and metabolic functions. Management of women with PCOS depends on the symptoms. These could be ovulatory dysfunction-related infertility, menstrual disorders, or androgen-related symptoms. Weight loss improves the endocrine profile and increases the likelihood of ovulation and pregnancy. Normalization of menstrual cycles and ovulation could occur with modest weight loss as little as 5% of the initial weight. The treatment of obesity includes modifications in lifestyle (diet and exercise) and medical and surgical treatment. In PCOS, anovulation relates to low follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations and the arrest of antral follicle growth in the final stages of maturation. This can be treated with medications such as clomiphene citrate, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, metformin, glucocorticoids, or gonadotropins or surgically by laparoscopic ovarian drilling. In vitro fertilization will remain the last option to achieve pregnancy when others fail. Chronic anovulation over a long period of time is also associated with an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, which should be seriously investigated and treated. There are androgenic symptoms that will vary from patient to patient, such as hirsutism, acne, and/or alopecia. These are troublesome presentations to the patients and require adequate treatment.

For secondary outcomes, lifestyle intervention provided benefits when compared to minimal treatment for endpoint values for total testosterone (mean difference (MD) -0.27 nmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.46 to -0.09, P = 0.004), hirsutism by the Ferriman-Gallwey score (MD -1.19, 95% CI -2.35 to -0.03, P = 0.04), weight (MD -3.47 kg, 95% CI -4.94 to -2.00, P < 0.00001), waist circumference (MD -1.95 cm, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.57, P = 0.006), waist to hip ratio (MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.00, P = 0.02), fasting insulin (MD -2.02 µU/mL, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.77, P = 0.002) and oral glucose tolerance test insulin (standardised mean difference -1.32, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.92, P < 0.00001) and per cent weight change (MD -7.00%, 95% CI -10.1 to -3.90, P < 0.00001). There was no evidence of effect of lifestyle for body mass index, free androgen index, sex hormone binding globulin, glucose or lipids; and no data for quality of life, patient satisfaction or acne.

Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are intrinsically insulin resistant and have a high risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Weight loss improves risk factors, but the optimal diet composition is unknown. Low-glycemic index (low-GI) diets are recommended without evidence of their clinical effectiveness.


OBJECTIVE
We compared changes in insulin sensitivity and clinical outcomes after similar weight losses after consumption of a low-GI diet compared with a conventional healthy diet in women with PCOS.


DESIGN
We assigned overweight and obese premenopausal women with PCOS (n = 96) to consume either an ad libitum low-GI diet or a macronutrient-matched healthy diet and followed the women for 12 mo or until they achieved a 7% weight loss. We compared changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity, which we assessed using the insulin sensitivity index derived from the oral-glucose-tolerance test (ISI(OGTT)); glucose tolerance; body composition; plasma lipids; reproductive hormones; health-related quality of life; and menstrual cycle regularity.


RESULTS
The attrition rate was high in both groups (49%). Among completers, ISI(OGTT) improved more with the low-GI diet than with the conventional healthy diet (mean +/- SEM: 2.2 +/- 0.7 compared with 0.7 +/- 0.6, respectively; P = 0.03). There was a significant diet-metformin interaction (P = 0.048), with greater improvement in ISI(OGTT) among women prescribed both metformin and the low-GI diet. Compared with women who consumed the conventional healthy diet, more women who consumed the low-GI diet showed improved menstrual cyclicity (95% compared with 63%, respectively; P = 0.03). Among the biochemical measures, only serum fibrinogen concentrations showed significant differences between diets (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first objective evidence to justify the use of low-GI diets in the management of PCOS.",American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,2010,171.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1403072428', 'name': 'K.

METHODS A literature search was conducted (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, clinical trial registries and hand-searching) identifying studies reporting prevalence or incidence of IGT, DM2 or metabolic syndrome in women with and without PCOS. Data were presented as odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] with fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis by Mantel-Haenszel methods. Quality testing was based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scaling and The Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias assessment tool. Literature searching, data abstraction and quality appraisal were performed by two investigators. RESULTS A total of 2192 studies were reviewed and 35 were selected for final analysis. Women with PCOS had increased prevalence of IGT (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.63, 3.77; BMI-matched studies OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.44, 4.47), DM2 (OR 4.43, 95% CI 4.06, 4.82; BMI-matched studies OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.97, 8.10) and metabolic syndrome (OR 2.88, 95% CI 2.40, 3.45; BMI-matched studies OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.36, 3.56).

Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased prevalence of insulin resistance and display subclinical evidence of early cardiovascular disease. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and circulating markers of cardiovascular risk in patients with PCOS, but it is unclear whether this translates into improvements in vascular function.


OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to evaluate the effects of metformin on arterial stiffness and endothelial function in women with PCOS.


DESIGN AND INTERVENTION
Thirty women with PCOS were assigned to consecutive 12-wk treatment periods of metformin or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design separated by an 8-wk washout.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The primary outcome measures were assessments of arterial stiffness [augmentation index (AIx), central blood pressure, and brachial and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV)] and endothelial function. Anthropometry, testosterone, and metabolic biochemistry (lipids, homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) were also assessed.


RESULTS
Metformin improved AIx [-6.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference -8.5 to -3.5%; P < 0.001], aortic PWV (-0.76 m/sec; 95% CI for the difference -1.12 to -0.4 m/sec; P < 0.001), brachial PWV (-0.73 m/sec; 95% CI for the difference -1.09 to -0.38; P < 0.001), central blood pressure (P < 0.001), and endothelium-dependent (AIx after albuterol; P = 0.003) and endothelium-independent (AIx after nitroglycerin; P < 0.001) vascular responses. Metformin also reduced weight (P < 0.001), waist circumference (P < 0.001), and triglycerides (P = 0.004) and increased adiponectin (P = 0.001) but did not affect testosterone or other metabolic measures.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by anovulation, hyperandrogaenemia and insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinaemia is associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk and the development of diabetes mellitus. If insulin sensitising agents such as metformin are effective in treating features of PCOS, then they could have wider health benefits than just treating the symptoms of the syndrome.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effectiveness of insulin sensitising drugs in improving reproductive outcomes and metabolic parameters for women with PCOS and menstrual disturbance.


SEARCH STRATEGY
We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders & Subfertility Group trials register (searched September 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, third Quarter 2008), CINAHL (searched September 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2008), and EMBASE (January 1985 to September 2008). All searches were rerun 13 August 2009 17 RCTs were located and await classification.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials which investigated the effect of insulin sensitising drugs compared with either placebo or no treatment, or compared with an ovulation induction agent.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Thirty one trials (2537 women) were included for analysis, 27 of them using metformin and involving 2150 women.


MAIN RESULTS
There is no evidence that metformin improves live birth rates whether it is used alone (Pooled OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.39) or in combination with clomiphene (Pooled OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.95). However, clinical pregnancy rates are improved for metformin versus placebo (Pooled OR = OR 3.86, 95% C.I. 2.18 to 6.84) and for metformin and clomiphene versus clomiphene alone (Pooled OR =1.48, 95% C.I. 1.12 to 1.95) ). In the studies that compared metformin and clomiphene alone, there was no evidence of an improved live birth rate (OR= 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.02) but the pooled OR resulted in improved clinical pregnancy rate in in the clomiphene group (OR = 0.63 , 95% 0.43 to 0.92), although there was significant heterogeneity.There is also evidence that ovulation rates are improved with metformin in women with PCOS for metformin versus placebo (Pooled OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.50 to 3.0) and for metformin and clomiphene versus clomiphene alone (Pooled OR = 3.46, 95% CI 1.97 to 6.07).Metformin was also associated with a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance, but no serious adverse effects were reported.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
In agreement with the previous review, metformin is still of benefit in improving clinical pregnancy and ovulation rates. However, there is no evidence that metformin improves live birth rates whether it is used alone or in combination with clomiphene, or when compared with clomiphene. Therefore, the use of metformin in improving reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS appears to be limited.",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2010,464.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2250172', 'name': 'T.

This prospective, randomized, parallel study assessed the added benefit of aerobic or aerobic-resistance exercise training when combined with a moderate hypocaloric weight-loss diet on metabolic risk factors and reproductive function in women with PCOS. Ninety-four overweight and obese women with PCOS (age, 18-41 years; body mass index, 25-55 kg/m 2 ) were randomized to receive diet only (DO), diet and aerobic exercise (DA), or diet and combined aerobic-resistance exercise (DC) for 20 weeks. All participants received the same energy-restricted, high-protein diet (5000-6000 kJ/d). Fat mass was decreased more and free fat-free mass was decreased less at 20 weeks among the women in the DA and DC groups compared with those in the DO group (all values, P < 0.05). Larger reductions occurred in systolic and diastolic blood pressure among women in the DA and DC groups than those in the DO group, but only the decrease within the DC group reached statistical significance (P < 0.01). Statistically significant reductions from baseline values occurred within both the DA and DC groups for fasting insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, testosterone, and free androgen index (all values, P < 0.05). Compared with baseline values, increases were found within the DA and DC groups in levels of serum sex hormone binding globulin. With respect to reproductive function, there were improvements in ovulation and menstrual cyclicity over the 20-week study period within the 3 treatment groups. There were no statistically significant differences in these cardiometabolic, hormonal, and reproductive parameters between the treatment groups. Among women with PCOS on an energy-restricted high-protein diet, the lack of additional improvements by exercise in cardiometabolic risk factors, hormonal status, and reproductive function suggests that improvements in these parameters were primarily related to energy restriction and weight loss.",,2009,61.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '38803565', 'name': 'R.

Women of reproductive age, who are overweight or obese, are prone to infertility. Weight loss in these women leads to increased fecundity, higher chances of conception after infertility treatment and improved pregnancy outcome. In spite of the advantages, most patients have difficulty in losing weight and often regain lost weight over time. This review assesses whether treatment with insulin sensitizing drugs contributes to weight loss, compared with diet or a lifestyle modification programme.


METHODS
After a systematic search of the literature, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), investigating the effect of insulin sensitizing drugs on weight loss compared with placebo and diet and/or a lifestyle modification programme, were included. Subjects were restricted to women of reproductive age. The main outcome measure was change in body mass index (BMI).


RESULTS
Only 14 trials, unintentionally all but two on women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) only, were included in the analysis. Treatment with metformin showed a statistically significant decrease in BMI compared with placebo (weighted mean difference, -0.68; 95% CI -1.13 to -0.24). There was some indication of greater effect with high-dose metformin (>1500 mg/day) and longer duration of therapy (>8 weeks). Limitations were power, low use of intention-to-treat analysis and heterogeneity of the studies.


CONCLUSION
A structured lifestyle modification programme to achieve weight loss should still be the first line treatment in obese women with or without PCOS. Adequately powered RCTs are required to confirm the findings of this review and to assess whether the addition of high-dose metformin therapy to a structured lifestyle modification programme might contribute to more weight loss.",Human Reproduction Update,2008,121.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '1403723123', 'name': 'A.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. The aim of this retrospective audit was to determine the patient profile, including anthropometrics, biochemistry and symptoms, and to evaluate the influence of a dietary intervention in women with PCOS.


METHODS
Data were collected retrospectively from dietetic and medical records from all PCOS patients (n = 88) who attended a dietetic consultation from July 2004 to July 2006. As standard clinic practice, a reduced glycaemic load diet had been prescribed, with energy reduction in overweight patients. Follow-up data were available for 59 patients.


RESULTS
Fifty-eight patients had a body mass index (BMI) <or= 24.9 kg m(-2) and 30 had a BMI >or= 25 kg m(-2). Thirty-six patients, with a BMI <or= 24.9 kg m(-2), self-reported central weight gain at their initial appointment. Over two-thirds of patients self-reported one or more of the following symptoms: carbohydrate cravings, hypoglycaemia, tiredness and hunger. At the follow-up appointment, BMI and waist circumference significantly decreased in overweight patients (P < 0.05). Seventy-one percent of women self-reported hypoglycaemia initially; this was reduced to 13% at follow-up (P < 0.01).

Lifestyle modifications are successfully employed to treat obese and overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aims of the current pilot study were (i) to compare the efficacy on reproductive functions of a structured exercise training (SET) programme with a diet programme in obese PCOS patients and (ii) to study their clinical, hormonal and metabolic effects to elucidate potentially different mechanisms of action.


METHODS
Forty obese PCOS patients with anovulatory infertility underwent a SET programme (SET group, n = 20) and a hypocaloric hyperproteic diet (diet group, n = 20). Clinical, hormonal and metabolic data were assessed at baseline, and at 12- and 24-week follow-ups. Primary endpoint was cumulative pregnancy rate.


RESULTS
The two groups had similar demographic, anthropometric and biochemical parameters. After intervention, a significant improvement in menstrual cycles and fertility was noted in both groups, with no differences between groups. The frequency of menses and the ovulation rate were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the SET group than in diet group but the increased cumulative pregnancy rate was not significant. Body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, insulin resistance indexes and serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate changed significantly (P < 0.05) from baseline and were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the two groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Both SET and diet interventions improve fertility in obese PCOS patients with anovulatory infertility.

She has taken oral contraceptive pills in the past but did not tolerate them and is not currently receiving any treatment. She has three or four menstrual periods per year and is not interested in becoming pregnant now, but she will be getting married in a year. She has heard that the polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with diabetes and is concerned because both her mother and father have type 2 diabetes. Her bodymass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) is 32, her waist circumference is 38 in. (96.5 cm), her serum total testosterone level is elevated at 0.9 ng per milliliter (90 ng per deciliter, or 2.9 nmol per liter), her plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is 35 mg per deciliter (0.9 mmol per liter), and her triglyceride level is 190 mg per deciliter (2.1 mmol per liter). Her serum glucose level 2 hours after the ingestion of 75 g of dextrose is 138 mg per deciliter (7.7 mmol per liter). The physician wonders whether treatment with metformin would be beneficial and refers the patient to an endocrinologist. T h e C l i nic a l Probl e m The polycystic ovary syndrome is a clinical diagnosis characterized by the presence of two or more of the following features: chronic oligo-ovulation or anovulation, androgen excess, and polycystic ovaries. 1 It affects 5 to 10% of women of childbearing age 2,3 and is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility in developed countries. Common clinical manifestations include menstrual irregularities and signs of androgen excess such as hirsutism, acne, and alopecia. The polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with important metabolic derangements. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the United States is 10 times as high among young women with the polycystic ovary syndrome as among normal women, 4,5 and impaired glucose tolerance or overt type 2 diabetes develops by the age of 30 years in 30 to 50% of obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. 4‑6 The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is two to three times as high among women with the polycystic ovary syndrome as among normal women matched for age and body-mass index, and 20% of women with the polycystic ovary syndrome who are younger than 20 years of age have the metabolic syndrome. 7 Although outcome data specifically for women with the polycystic ovary syndrome are lacking, the risk of fatal myocardial infarction is twice as high among women with severe oligomenorrhea, most of whom would be expected to have the polycystic ovary syndrome, as among women with eumenorrhea. 8 This Journal feature begins with a case vignette that includes a therapeutic recommendation. A discussion of the clinical problem and the mechanism of benefit of this form of therapy follows.

Our aim was to assess the effects of metformin on menstrual frequency, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin resistance assessed as HOMA-index, weight, waist/hip ratio, blood pressure (BP), serum lipids, and testosterone levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, double-blinded setup, 56 women aged 18-45 with PCOS were treated with either metformin 850 mg or placebo twice daily for 6 months. After a wash-out period of 3 months participants received the alternate treatment for 6 months. The changes in the measured parameters were analysed by intention-to-treat and per protocol.


RESULTS
There were no changes in menstrual frequency. In the intention-to-treat analysis, weight and systolic BP were reduced on metformin treatment (p=0.009 and 0.047, respectively), while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) increased (p=0.001). On placebo, weight and FPG increased (p<0.05). Post-hoc subgrouping according to BMI revealed reductions in testosterone (p=0.013), FPG (p=0.018), insulin (p=0.045) and HOMA-index (p=0.022) in obese women. Per protocol analysis showed the following differences between the changes on placebo and metformin (mean (5 - 95 % percentiles): weight (-4.2 (-7.0, -1.9) kg, p<0.001), FPG (-0.23 (-0.44, -0.01) mmol/l, p=0.041), insulin (-4.17 (-8.10, -0.23) mIU/l, p=0.039) and HOMA index (-1.50 (-2.53, -0.47) mIU/l*mmol/l, p=0.006). Weight, FPG and HOMA index were lower after metformin than after placebo.

Addition of anti-obesity drugs allows keeping the weight loss during years and improving obesity-related comorbidities. Methods This review is an actualisation on efficacy, safety and tolerability of the approved drugs on the long-term treatment of obesity (orlistat and sibutramine). New indications and effects of their use far beyond the weight loss are as well commented. Finally, potential benefits of the administration of CB1 antagonist rimonabant on the weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors are analysed in detail. Discussion A decade of experience on the use of orlistat and sibutramine has demonstrated their higher efficacy on the weight loss when compared to placebo either on adult or teenage population as well as safety and tolerability on long-term administration. Beneficial effects on the lipid profile, glycosilated haemoglobin on diabetic patients, blood pressure and levels of inflammatory cytokines, contribute to decrease the cardiovascular risk on obese patients. Phase III clinical trials using rimonabant show additional benefits to the expected weight loss, mainly reducing visceral fat and cardiometabolic risk factors.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disease closely related to several risk factors for cardiovascular disease. An impaired cardiopulmonary functional capacity was previously demonstrated in PCOS women. No data regarding the effects of a structured exercise training (ET) program on cardiopulmonary functional capacity in PCOS women are available.


OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to evaluate the effects of a 3-month ET program on cardiopulmonary functional capacity in young PCOS women.


DESIGN AND SETTING
A prospective baseline-randomized clinical study was conducted at the University ""Federico II"" of Naples, School of Medicine (Italy).


PATIENTS
Ninety young overweight PCOS women were enrolled.


MEAN OUTCOME MEASURES
Ninety young PCOS women were randomly subdivided into two groups, each composed of 45 subjects. The PCOS-T (trained) group underwent a 3-month structured ET program, whereas the PCOS-UnT (untrained) group did not. Hormonal and metabolic profiles and cardiopulmonary and exercise parameters were evaluated.


RESULTS
After 3-month ET, PCOS-T showed a significant improvement in peak oxygen consumption (+35.4%; P<0.001) and in maximal workload (+37.2%; P<0.001). In PCOS-T we also observed a significant reduction in body mass index (-4.5%; P<0.001) and in C-reactive protein (-10%; P<0.001), and a significant (P<0.001) improvement in insulin sensitivity indexes. After 3 months, no changes were observed in PCOS-UnT.

Effective approaches to nutrition and exercise improve endocrine features, reproductive function and cardiometabolic risk profile – even without marked weight loss. Recent studies allow us to make recommendations on macronutrient intake. Fat should be restricted to ≤30% of total calories with a low proportion of saturated fat. High intake of low GI carbohydrate contributes to dyslipidaemia and weight gain and also stimulates hunger and carbohydrate craving. Diet and exercise need to be tailored to the individual's needs and preferences. Calorie intake should be distributed between several meals per day with low intake from snacks and drinks. Use of drugs to either improve insulin sensitivity or to promote weight loss are justified as a short-term measure, and are most likely to be beneficial when used early in combination with diet and exercise.",Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Research,2007,64.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '9790875', 'name': 'H.

The Rotterdam criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) defines discrete subgroups whose phenotypes are not yet clear.


OBJECTIVE
The phenotypic characteristics of women in the PCOS subgroups defined by the Rotterdam criteria were compared.


DESIGN
The study was observational.


SETTING
Subjects were studied in an outpatient setting in Boston and Reykjavik.


PATIENTS
Four subgroups of subjects with PCOS defined by 1) irregular menses (IM), hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM, n = 298); 2) IM/HA (n = 7); 3) HA/PCOM (n = 77); and 4) IM/PCOM (n = 36) and a group of controls (n = 64), aged 18-45 yr, were examined.


INTERVENTION
Subjects underwent a physical exam; fasting blood samples for androgens, gonadotropins, and metabolic parameters; and a transvaginal ultrasound.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The phenotype was compared between groups.


RESULTS
Ninety-seven percent of women with IM/HA had PCOM. Therefore, the groups with and without PCOM were combined. The Ferriman-Gallwey score and androgen levels were highest in the hyperandrogenic groups (IM/HA and HA/PCOM), whereas ovarian volume was higher in all PCOS subgroups compared with controls, as expected based on the definitions of the PCOS subgroups. Body mass index and insulin levels were highest in the IM/HA subgroup.


CONCLUSIONS
Subjects with PCOS defined by IM/HA are the most severely affected women on the basis of androgen levels, ovarian volumes, and insulin levels.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a very common endocrinopathy with a heterogeneous presentation whose etiology is still uncertain. Not surprisingly, therefore, the definition of, and diagnostic criteria for, PCOS remain controversial.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of the study was to review and justify the basis for the recently revised definition of PCOS arising from the joint European Society for Human Reproduction & Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM) Rotterdam workshop in 2003.


INTERVENTION(S)
The Rotterdam criteria take account of the broad spectrum of presenting features of PCOS, including women with hyperandrogenism but regular menses and, more controversially, those with menstrual disturbance without overt androgen excess. POSITIONS: The Rotterdam criteria for definition and diagnosis of PCOS, in the opinion of this author, represent a significant advance in recognizing the broad spectrum of presentation of the syndrome and acknowledge that the clinical and biochemical features may vary with time within individuals. The important refinements when compared to the 1990 NIH definition of PCOS are: 1) inclusion of polycystic ovarian morphology; and 2) inclusion of subjects with hirsutism and regular menses.


CONCLUSIONS
These new diagnostic criteria for PCOS reflect the significant advances, particularly from studies of familial PCOS, in understanding of the etiology of the syndrome and the basis for its heterogeneity. Under the revised diagnostic criteria, the inclusion of women with hyperandrogenism and regular cycles has met with general agreement. The inclusion of women with oligomenorrhea and polycystic ovaries who do not have clear evidence of androgen excess is, in the opinion of this author, also justified but remains a contentious issue and one that requires further investigation.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2006,258.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '2377813', 'name': 'S.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined most commonly according to the proceedings of an expert conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in April 1990, which noted the disorder as having 1) hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia, 2) oligoovulation, and 3) exclusion of known disorders. Alternatively, another expert conference held in Rotterdam in May 2003 defined PCOS, after the exclusion of related disorders, by two of the following three features: 1) oligo- or anovulation, 2) clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, or 3) polycystic ovaries. In essence, the Rotterdam 2003 expanded the NIH 1990 definition creating two new phenotypes: 1) ovulatory women with polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism, and 2) oligoanovulatory women with polycystic ovaries, but without hyperandrogenism.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to ascertain the validity of using the Rotterdam 2003 criteria rather than the NIH 1991 criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS.


INTERVENTION(S)
Interventions included the use of the Rotterdam 2003 criteria for diagnosing PCOS and, in particular, the proposal to define two new phenotypes as PCOS. POSITIONS: Available data suggest that hyperandrogenic ovulatory women with polycystic ovaries tend to have mild insulin resistance and mild evidence of ovarian dysfunction, although significantly less than women with anovulatory PCOS. However, whether these women will have an increased risk of infertility or metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes, remains to be determined. Alternatively, the risk of insulin resistance and long-term metabolic risks of oligoovulatory women with polycystic ovaries is even less well characterized and may be nonexistent.


CONCLUSIONS
Because of the paucity of data on the two new phenotypes and their long-term implications and the potential negative impact on research, clinical practice, and patient insurability, the adoption of the Rotterdam 2003 criteria for defining PCOS should be considered premature. However, because polycystic ovaries are a frequent feature of PCOS, a modification of the NIH 1990 criteria is proposed. Additional research characterizing the phenotypes and associated morbidities of PCOS is urgently required.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2006,434.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '3920537', 'name': 'R.

366,c4324719747271bede039572d121deff91591120,Development of polycystic ovary syndrome: involvement of genetic and environmental factors.,"We have recently proposed that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has its origin in fetal life. This hypothesis is based on data from animal models (rhesus monkey or sheep that have been exposed prenatally to high doses of androgen) and is supported by clinical studies. It is suggested that, in human females, exposure to excess androgen, at any stage from fetal development of the ovary to the onset of puberty, leads to many of the characteristic features of PCOS, including abnormalities of luteinizing hormone secretion and insulin resistance. It is likely that, in humans with PCOS, the development of the PCOS phenotype results primarily from a genetic predisposition for the fetal ovary to hypersecrete androgen. At present, it is unclear whether the maternal environment directly influences the development of PCOS in the offspring. Maternal androgen excess is unlikely to affect the fetus, because the placenta presents an effective barrier, but metabolic disturbances during pregnancy could affect development of the syndrome in the fetus. In postnatal life, the natural history of PCOS can be further modified by factors affecting insulin secretion and/or action, most importantly, nutrition. We now have evidence for a disorder of early follicular development in the polycystic ovary that is consistent with an increased population of primordial follicles in the fetal ovary. It remains to be determined whether this phenomenon is the cause or the effect of increased exposure to androgen within the ovary. PCOS is the commonest endocrine disorder in women. It is not only a very prevalent cause of anovulatory infertility, menstrual disturbances and hirsutism, but it is also a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in later life. The aetiology of the syndrome remains uncertain but there is increasing evidence for a genetic basis. PCOS very often becomes clinically manifest during adolescence with maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis but the genesis of the syndrome may be during very early development - perhaps even in utero. In this review, this hypothesis is explored in the light of clinical, biochemical and genetic research.",International Journal of Andrology,2006,243.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '2377813', 'name': 'S.

The composition of the optimal diet for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is not yet known, but such a diet must not only assist short term with weight management, symptoms and fertility, but also specifically target the long-term risks of type 2 diabetes, CVD and certain cancers. With insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia now recognised as a key factor in the pathogenesis of PCOS, it has become clear that reducing insulin levels and improving insulin sensitivity are an essential part of management. Diet plays a significant role in the regulation of blood glucose and insulin levels, yet research into the dietary management of PCOS is lacking and most studies have focused on energy restriction rather than dietary composition per se. On the balance of evidence to date, a diet low in saturated fat and high in fibre from predominantly low-glycaemic-index-carbohydrate foods is recommended.

Although metformin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of anovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), clomiphene citrate (CC) is still considered to be the first-line drug to induce ovulation in these patients.


OBJECTIVE
The goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of metformin and CC administration as a first-line treatment in anovulatory women with PCOS.


DESIGN
We describe a prospective parallel randomized, double-blind, double-dummy controlled clinical trial.


SETTING
The study was conducted at the University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.


PATIENTS
One hundred nonobese primary infertile anovulatory women with PCOS participated.


INTERVENTIONS
We administered metformin cloridrate (850 mg twice daily) plus placebo (group A) or placebo plus CC (150 mg for 5 d from the third day of a progesterone withdrawal bleeding) (group B) for 6 months each.


MEAN OUTCOME MEASURES
The main outcome measures were ovulation, pregnancy, abortion, and live-birth rates.


RESULTS
The subjects of groups A (n = 45) and B (n = 47) were studied for a total of 205 and 221 cycles, respectively. The ovulation rate was not statistically different between either treatment group (62.9 vs. 67.0%, P = 0.38), whereas the pregnancy rate was significantly higher in group A than group B (15.1 vs. 7.2%, P = 0.009). The difference found between groups A and B regarding the abortion rate was significant (9.7 vs. 37.5%, P = 0.045), whereas a positive trend was observed for the live-birth rate (83.9 vs. 56.3%, P = 0.07). The cumulative pregnancy rate was significantly higher in group A than group B (68.9 vs. 34.0%, P < 0.001).

Twenty-one Caucasian women with PCOS [mean (+/-SEM) age 27 +/- 0.9 yr and body mass index 36.7 +/- 3.3 kg/m(2)] participated in this prospective, randomized, open-labeled study. All subjects had an 8-wk run-in period of dietary modification and then randomized to receive either metformin (500 mg three times daily) or orlistat (120 mg three times daily) for 3 months. Weight, blood pressure, and fasting blood samples were taken at screening, randomization, and on completion. Insulin resistance (IR) was calculated using the homeostasis model of assessment (HOMA)-IR method [HOMA-IR = (insulin x glucose)/22.5]. The results are expressed as mean +/- SEM. When compared with baseline, treatment with both orlistat [93.5 +/- 11.5 ng/dl (3.24 +/- 0.4 nmol/liter) vs. 114.5 +/- 11.5 ng/dl (3.97 +/- 0.4 nmol/liter), P = 0.039] and metformin [97.2 +/- 11.5 ng/dl (3.37 +/- 0.4 nmol/liter) vs. 120.0 +/- 8.7 ng/dl (4.16 +/- 0.3 nmol/liter), P = 0.048] produced a significant reduction in total testosterone. Treatment with orlistat produced a 4.69% reduction in weight (99.0 +/- 6.0 vs. 94.6 +/- 6.1 kg, P = 0.002), and this reduction was more significant than the reduction produced by metformin (4.69 vs. 1.02%, P = 0.006). There was no significant reduction seen after either treatment group for fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, SHBG, or any of the lipid parameters studied. In this study, orlistat produced a significant reduction in weight and total testosterone. The reduction in total testosterone was similar to that seen after treatment with metformin.

A hallmark feature of these conditions is impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Cross‐sectional and retrospective epidemiological studies have provided direct evidence that a lack of physical activity is strongly associated with IGT. Indeed, physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The primary defect(s) in the development of whole‐body insulin resistance remain unclear. However, during the past decade significant progress has been made towards an understanding of the molecular basis underlying the beneficial effects of exercise training in stimulating the entry of glucose into insulin‐sensitive tissues. Accordingly, it is now well accepted that regular physical exercise offers an effective therapeutic intervention to improve insulin action in skeletal muscle in insulin‐resistant individuals. This review provides evidence that physical inactivity is significantly associated with IGT and directly contributes to the cascade of events that lead to the expression of the ‘exercise‐deficient phenotype’ associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In contrast, exercise training will be shown to significantly reduce the risk of developing insulin resistance by improving glucose tolerance and insulin action in individuals predisposed to develop type 2 diabetes. Several putative mechanisms for enhanced glucose uptake after exercise training will be discussed. A determination of the underlying biological mechanisms that result from exercise training is essential in order to define the precise variations in physical activity that result in the most desired effects on targeted risk factors, and to aid in the development of such interventions.

The lack of well-defined diagnostic criteria makes identification of this common disease confusing to many clinicians. Also, with the varied manifestations of the disorder a patient may present to any one of several providers: an internist, family practitioner, nurse practitioner, pediatrician, gynecologist, dermatologist, or endocrinologist. Furthermore, the most distressing aspect of PCOS for any given patient may change over time, from hirsutism as a teenager to infertility as a young adult--potentially requiring several different providers along the way. It is important, therefore, that those caring for these patients understand not only the management issues pertinent to their specialty, but also appreciate the other potential health risks in these women. Recent insights into the pathophysiology of PCOS have shown insulin resistance to play a substantial role and as such have brought the long-term issues of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its resultant increased risk of coronary artery disease to the forefront. No longer can irregular menses and/or hirsutism be thought of as benign nuisances. This review will focus on the two most confusing aspects of PCOS for the practicing provider--diagnosis/differential diagnosis and treatment options. Special attention is given to the role of insulin resistance and the potential utility of insulin sensitizers in management. The benefit and utmost importance of lifestyle modification for the long-term health of these women is stressed as well. It is hoped that some clarity in this regard will allow more women to not only be diagnosed and managed properly for their presenting symptoms (hirsutism, irregular menses, etc.), but also to be educated and managed for the continuing health risk of insulin resistance throughout their lives.",Clinical Medicine Research,2004,221.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '143655405', 'name': 'M.

The heterogeneity of both the ovarian morphology and clinical findings in women with polycystic ovaries has been well recognized since Stein & Leventhal’s (1935) first report and gradually led to the establishment of the term polycystic ovary syndrome. The many features of this syndrome can be broadly divided into three categories: clinical, endocrine and metabolic. The clinical features include menstrual abnormalities, hirsutism, acne, alopecia, anovulatory infertility and recurrent miscarriages. The endocrine features include elevated androgens, luteinizing hormone, oestrogen and prolactin levels. The metabolic aspects of this syndrome include insulin resistance, obesity, lipid abnormalities and an increased risk for impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM). Controversy persists regarding the criteria used for PCOS diagnosis. Currently, the recommended diagnostic criteria for PCOS are hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction with the exclusion of specific disorders, such as nonclassic adrenal 21hydroxylase deficiency, Cushing’s syndrome, hyperprolactinaemia and androgen-producing tumours. This clinical definition reflects a 1990 National Institutes of Health–National Institute of Child Health and Development Consensus Conference (Zawadeski & Dunaif, 1992) in which there was poor agreement among the 58 specialists who completed a questionnaire on the diagnostic criteria for PCOS, with no single criterion endorsed as ‘definite or probable’ by more than 64% of respondents. Interestingly, the conclusion of this meeting was that the polycystic ovary morphology is consistent with, but not essential for, the diagnosis of the syndrome. Sonographic criteria for polycystic ovaries have been refined with advances in technology (Fox, 1999; Atiomo et al ., 2000) and transvaginal ultrasound is currently the gold standard for diagnosing polycystic ovaries. Using the most conservative criteria based on transabdominal ultrasound, the presence of 10 or more cysts, 2–8 mm in diameter, arranged either peripherally around a dense core of stroma or scattered throughout an increased amount of stroma (Adams et al ., 1985), up to 23% of normal volunteer women meet the sonographic criteria for polycystic ovaries (Clayton et al ., 1992). On the other hand, many investigators have maintained that ovaries from women with PCOS may be sonographically normal (Hann et al ., 1984; Timor-Tritsch & Rottem, 1998). Thus, the ovarian morphological changes must be distinguished from the endocrine syndrome of PCOS and be considered as a sign rather and not a disease.",Clinical Endocrinology,2004,156.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '12552638', 'name': 'T.

Exercise is reported to lower the incidence of cardiac events. The effect of exercise on plasma homocysteine concentrations, an independent cardiovascular risk factor, has not been previously reported in women with PCOS. We examined the effects of exercise on plasma total homocysteine concentrations in young overweight or obese PCOS women [age (mean +/- SD), 30.6 +/- 6.6 yr; body mass index, 35.49 +/- 7.57 kg/m(2)]. Twenty-one women consented to a 6-month exercise program; 12 women (exercisers) adhered to the program, whereas 9 (nonexercisers) did not. In both groups of women, the following parameters were recorded at baseline and 6 months: body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and aerobic capacity (maximal oxygen consumption); blood samples were taken after an overnight fast for plasma total homocysteine, insulin, and other biochemical parameters. A significant decrease in plasma total homocysteine concentrations (P < 0.001) and waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.041) and a significant increase in maximal oxygen consumption (P = 0.019) were recorded at 6 months, compared with baseline in the exercise group. This decrease in homocysteine was not explained by changes in anthropometric or biochemical parameters. In contrast, no significant changes in any of the variables were observed in the nonexercise group.

A 6-week very low calorie diet was followed by a 4-week normocaloric period. The urinary LH and FSH results reported represent samples taken 12 to 2 days before the LH surge, or 10 consecutive samples in the case of amenorrhea. We observed a decrease of 8% (P < 0.001) in percent body fat mass and a 5% (P < 0.005) reduction in waist to hip ratio. Mean nu-LH decreased by 45% [6.06 +/- 1.05 (+/-SEM) to 3.22 +/- 0.71 IU/L], whereas mean nu-FSH remained unchanged. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake increased by 41% (P < 0.01), which was accounted for by a significant increase in nonoxidative glucose disposal (P = 0.003). Serum sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations increased by 39% (P < 0.01), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) levels increased by 46% (P < 0.05). Fasting serum insulin concentrations decreased by 38%, those of leptin by 37%, those of androstenedione by 32%, those of testosterone by 20% (all P < 0.01), and those of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate by 13% (P < 0.05). The percent change in nu-LH correlated negatively with glucose uptake (r = -0.76; P < 0.01) and the increase in serum sex hormone-binding globulin (r = -0.85; P < 0.005) and positively with the percent change in waist to hip ratio (r = 0.79; P < 0.01). The absolute nu-LH levels after weight reduction correlated significantly with fasting insulin concentrations (r = 0.88; P < 0.001) and negatively with glucose uptake (r = -0.67; P < 0.05). No significant relationships were found between absolute levels or changes in nu-LH concentrations and leptin, IGF-I, IGFBP-3, or IGFBP-1 concentrations. Our findings suggest that weight reduction with a very low calorie diet results in a decrease in nu-LH concentrations, a reduction in the LH/FSH ratio, and FSH predominance favoring folliculogenesis. The decrease in LH concentrations is inversely related to the severity of insulin resistance. It is possible that the decrease in LH secretion with weight reduction is more dependent on the absolute levels of insulin sensitivity than on the degree of general adiposity.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2000,49.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '11182704', 'name': 'T.

Dietary-induced weight loss and the administration of insulin-lowering drugs, such as metformin, are usually followed by improved hyperandrogenism and related clinical abnormalities. This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of combined hypocaloric diet and metformin on body weight, fat distribution, the glucose-insulin system, and hormones in a group of 20 obese PCOS women [body mass index (BMI) > 28 kg/m2] with the abdominal phenotype (waist to hip ratio >0.80), and an appropriate control group of 20 obese women who were comparable for age and pattern of body fat distribution but without PCOS. At baseline, we measured sex hormone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and leptin blood concentrations and performed an oral glucose tolerance test and computerized tomography (CT) at the L4-L5 level, to measure sc adipose tissue area (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue area. All women were then given a low-calorie diet (1,200-1,400 kcal/day) alone for one month, after which anthropometric parameters and CT scan were newly measured. While continuing dietary treatment, PCOS women and obese controls were subsequently placed, in a random order, on metformin (850 mg/os, twice daily) (12 and 8, respectively) or placebo (8 and 12, respectively), according to a double-blind design, for the following 6 months. Blood tests and the CT scan were performed in each woman at the end of the study while they were still on treatment. During the treatment period, 3 women of the control group (all treated with placebo) were excluded because of noncompliance; and 2 PCOS women, both treated with metformin, were also excluded because they became pregnant. Therefore, the women cohort available for final statistical analysis included 18 PCOS (10 treated with metformin and 8 with placebo) and 17 control women (8 treated with metformin and 9 with placebo). The treatment was well tolerated. In the PCOS group, metformin therapy improved hirsutism and menstrual cycles significantly more than placebo. Baseline anthropometric and CT parameters were similar in all groups. Hypocaloric dieting for 1 month similarly reduced BMI values and the waist circumference in both PCOS and control groups, without any significant effect on CT scan parameters. In both PCOS and control women, however, metformin treatment reduced body weight and BMI significantly more than placebo. Changes in the waist-to-hip ratio values were similar in PCOS women and controls, regardless of pharmacological treatment. Metformin treatment significantly decreased SAT values in both PCOS and control groups, although only in the latter group were SAT changes significantly greater than those observed during the placebo treatment. On the contrary, visceral adipose tissue area values significantly decreased during metformin treatment in both PCOS and control groups, but only in the former was the effect of metformin treatment significantly higher than that of placebo. Fasting insulin significantly decreased in both PCOS women and controls, regardless of treatment, whereas glucose-stimulated insulin significantly decreased only in PCOS women and controls treated with metformin. Neither metformin or placebo significantly modified the levels of LH, FSH, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, and progesterone in any group, whereas testosterone concentrations decreased only in PCOS women treated with metformin. SHBG concentrations remained unchanged in all PCOS women; whereas in the control group, they significantly increased after both metformin and placebo. Leptin levels decreased only during metformin treatment in both PCOS and control groups.

However, the results of these studies, mostly uncontrolled and short-term, are still inconclusive, and there is no long-term follow-up. In the present study, 23 PCOS subjects [mean (+/- SE) body mass index 30.0+/-1.1 kg/m2] were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with metformin (500 mg tid) or placebo for 6 months, while maintaining their usual eating habits. Before and after treatment, menstrual history, endocrine and metabolic profiles, serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone response to GnRH-agonist testing, and insulin sensitivity measured by the glucose clamp technique were assessed. Eighteen of these women, as well as 14 additional PCOS patients, were subsequently given metformin in an open trial for 11.0+/-1.3 months (range 4-26), to assess long-term effects of treatment and baseline predictors of metformin efficacy on reproductive abnormalities. After metformin treatment, mean frequency of menstruation improved (P = 0.002), due to striking amelioration of menstrual abnormalities in about 50% of subjects. Women given metformin showed reduced plasma insulin (at fasting: P = 0.057; during the clamp studies: P<0.01) and increased insulin sensitivity (P<0.05). Concurrently, ovarian hyperandrogenism was attenuated, as indicated by significant reductions in serum free testosterone (P<0.05) and in the 17-hydroxyprogesterone response to GnRH-agonist testing (P<0.05). No changes were found in the placebo group. Only comparable minor changes in body mass index were found both in the metformin group and in the placebo group. In the open, long-term trial 17 women (54.8%) showed striking improvements of their menstrual abnormalities and were considered as responders. Logistic regression analysis of baseline characteristics in responders and nonresponders showed that plasma insulin, serum androstenedione, and menstrual history were independent predictors of the treatment's clinical efficacy. In 10 subjects whose menses proved regular after treatment, the great majority of cycles became ovulatory (32 out of 39 assessed, 79%). In conclusion, in women with PCOS metformin treatment reduced hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia, independently of changes in body weight. In a large number of subjects these changes were associated with striking, sustained improvements in menstrual abnormalities and resumption of ovulation. Higher plasma insulin, lower serum androstenedione, and less severe menstrual abnormalities are baseline predictors of clinical response to metformin.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,2000,713.0,['Medicine'],"[{'authorId': '6291333', 'name': 'P.

We studied the relationship between insulin sensitivity and ovulation patterns in 18 infertile anovulatory obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women (NO) with normal glucose tolerance, aged between 22-39 yr with a body mass index of 27-45 kg/m2, before and after a 6-month diet and exercise program. This program promotes healthy lifestyle factors, but does not lead to rapid weight loss. The anthropometric, metabolic, and endocrine factors of these subjects were compared to those of 10 age- and weight-matched PCOS women with regular monthly ovulation (RO). Before lifestyle modification, the anovulatory subjects had greater central obesity than regular ovulators, as assessed by percent central fat (NO, 45.7 +/- 0.8%; RO, 42.2 +/- 1.6%; P < 0.05), higher glucose increment after glucose challenge (NO, 10.1 +/- 1.0 mmol/L; RO, 6.4 +/- 1.1 mmol/L; P < 0.02), lower insulin sensitivity index (NO, 1.2 +/- 0.2; RO, 2.8 +/- 0.6 micromol/kg x min/pmol/L; P < 0.005), higher plasma LH (NO, 8.9 +/- 0.9; RO, 4.6 +/- 0.9 IU/L; P < 0.005), and lower plasma sex hormone-binding globulin (NO, 18.0 +/- 2.5; RO, 27.8 +/- 5.7 nmol/L; P < 0.05]. Anovulatory subjects were classified as responders (R) to the intervention if they regained ovulation during the study. As a result of intervention, R showed an 11% reduction in central fat, a 71% improvement in insulin sensitivity index, a 33% fall in fasting insulin levels, and a 39% reduction in LH levels. None of these parameters changed significantly in nonresponders (NR). At the end of the study, R had lower fasting insulin (R, 13.6 +/- 1.7; NR, 23.0 +/- 3.5 mU/L) and LH levels (R, 5.0 +/- 1.7; NR, 7.4 +/- 1.4 IU/L), but similar androgen levels compared to NR. We conclude that lifestyle modification without rapid weight loss leads to a reduction of central fat and improved insulin sensitivity, which restores ovulation in overweight infertile women with PCOS. Lifestyle modification is the best initial management for obese women seeking to improve their reproductive function.",Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,1999,525.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '1421997332', 'name': 'M.

387,c258348ed829fb89bbc85ebbe07aa4896deb8047,Evidence for a genetic basis for hyperandrogenemia in polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Our preliminary family studies have suggested that some female first-degree relatives of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have hyperandrogenemia per se. It was our hypothesis that this may be a genetic trait and thus could represent a phenotype suitable for linkage analysis. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined 115 sisters of 80 probands with PCOS from unrelated families. PCOS was diagnosed by the combination of elevated serum androgen levels and </=6 menses per year with the exclusion of secondary causes. The sisters were compared with 70 healthy age- and weight-comparable control women with regular menses, no clinical evidence of hyperandrogenemia, and normal glucose tolerance. Twenty-two percent of the sisters fulfilled diagnostic criteria for PCOS. In addition, 24% of the sisters had hyperandrogenemia and regular menstrual cycles. Circulating testosterone (T) and nonsex hormone-binding globulin-bound testosterone (uT) levels in both of these groups of sisters were significantly increased compared with unaffected sisters and control women (P < 0.0001 for both T and uT). Probands, sisters with PCOS, and hyperandrogenemic sisters had elevated serum luteinizing hormone levels compared with control women. We conclude that there is familial aggregation of hyperandrogenemia (with or without oligomenorrhea) in PCOS kindreds. In affected sisters, only one-half have oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia characteristic of PCOS, whereas the remaining one-half have hyperandrogenemia per se. This familial aggregation of hyperandrogenemia in PCOS kindreds suggests that it is a genetic trait. We propose that hyperandrogenemia be used to assign affected status in linkage studies designed to identify PCOS genes.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1998,657.0,"['Biology', 'Medicine']","[{'authorId': '6133498', 'name': 'R.

In this prospective study, a weight loss programme was assessed to determine whether it could help obese infertile women, irrespective of their infertility diagnosis, to achieve a viable pregnancy, ideally without further medical intervention. The subjects underwent a weekly programme aimed at lifestyle changes in relation to exercise and diet for 6 months; those that did not complete the 6 months were treated as a comparison group. Women in the study lost an average of 10.2 kg/m2, with 60 of the 67 anovulatory subjects resuming spontaneous ovulation, 52 achieving a pregnancy (18 spontaneously) and 45 a live birth. The miscarriage rate was 18%, compared to 75% for the same women prior to the programme. Psychometric measurements also improved. None of these changes occurred in the comparison group. The cost savings of the programme were considerable. Prior to the programme, the 67 women had had treatment costing a total of A$550,000 for two live births, a cost of A$275,000 per baby.

In the mouse, the best species characterized so far, the zona pellucida protein 3 (ZP3) has a central role as the specific, primary sperm receptor on the zona and as the inducer of the acrosome reaction. This sequence of events is not clearly understood as it relates to human gametes. The ideal test for the evaluation of sperm-zona pellucida interaction is one that can examine these events in a sequential fashion (i.e. binding followed by the acrosome reaction) in a standardized and specific bioassay. Here we have used the hemizona assay as an internally controlled test to examine human sperm-zona pellucida interaction. Results presented show that: (i) the hemizona assay has an excellent predictive power for IVF outcome and for the identification of male infertility; (ii) using a specific anti-ZP3 antiserum in immunocytochemical studies, the hemizona assay allows for the identification of structural/functional anomalies of the protein backbone of human ZP3 (identification of oocyte anomalies); and (iii) glycobiological studies using the hemizona assay model indicate that the initial sperm-zona pellucida binding requires a seletin-like interaction between the human gametes.

Insulin sensitivity (euglycemic insulin clamp), insulin secretion and glucose tolerance (iv glucose tolerance test), basal sex steroid hormones, gonadotropins and free fatty acids (FFA), skin folds and waist hip ratio (WHR) were evaluated before (PCO-BD) and after (PCO-AD) diet-induced weight reduction to a weight stable level [mean (SD) diet duration 14.9 (6.2) months]. Mean weight loss was 12.4 kg (4.7; P < 0.0001), equalling a reduction from a body mass index (BMI) of 32.2 (3.7) kg/m2 to 27.6 (3.7; P < 0.0001) kg/m2. The results were compared with those of two groups of weight stable (no diet) women, 21 with PCOS (PCO-ND) and 23 normal control subjects (C), who were matched to the BMI the diet group reached after weight loss. Insulin sensitivity index (M/I) improved on average 132% (P < 0.001) and plasma FFA by 32% (P < 0.01), serum sex hormone binding globulin levels increased by 35% (P < 0.01), and the sum of truncal-abdominal skin-folds (subscapular, umbilical, and suprailiacal) were reduced by 28% (P < 0.0001), whereas the early insulin response to iv glucose, the levels of gonadotropins and androstenedione, and the femoral sc fat did not change significantly with weight loss. M/I, levels of SHBG and FFA and truncal-abdominal fat reached levels similar to the controls, whereas PCO-ND had lower M/I (P < 0.01) and SHBG levels (P < 0.0001), greater concentrations of FFA (P < 0.01) and truncal-abdominal fat (P < 0.05) than C. Among women with normal glucose tolerance, the insulin increment was higher in both PCO-AD (P < 0.05) and PCO-ND (P < 0.01) than in C. There was a strong correlation between M/I and sum of truncal-abdominal skinfolds in all groups (PCO-BD: r = 0.82; P < 0.001, PCO-AD: r = 0.68; P < 0.05, PCO-ND: r = 0.81; P < 0.0001, C: r = 0.44; P < 0.05). The variation in M/I in PCO-AD and PCO-ND (pooled) was best explained by FFA and truncal-adbominal fat (model R2 = 0.67).
